# Indexing Systems {background-color="#438496"}

## Introduction

-   [Indexing operations]{style="color: blue;"} have been [performed intellectually by human
    indexers]{style="color: red;"} or quite a long time

-   [Automatic systems]{style="color: blue;"} have been developed recently where [text analysis
    and indexing are performed by computers]{style="color: red;"}

-   The [basic tasks]{style="color: blue;"} involved in indexing are same, i.e. to [analyse the
    content]{style="color: red;"} of a given document and [represent the analysis by some
    content identifiers or keywords]{style="color: blue;"}

-   [Lancaster]{style="color: blue;"} mentions that the process of [subject indexing involves 2
    distinct intellectual steps]{style="color: red;"}, **conceptual analysis**, and
    **representation**

-   [Subject Classification]{style="color: blue;"} includes [arrangement of documents]{style="color: red;"} according
    to their [subject content]{style="color: blue;"} by

## Introduction (Cnt.)

[notational systems such as DDC, UDC, LoC Classification]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Subject Indexing is the process to [match the contents of documents]{style="color: blue;"}
    with [users' queries]{style="color: red;"} and is [represented in a natural language form]{style="color: blue;"}
    such as [PRECIS, POPSI, Relational Indexing, Chain Indexing]{style="color: red;"}

-   One [basic problem]{style="color: blue;"} involved in the process of subject indexing is the
    [choice of appropriate keywords or descriptors]{style="color: red;"} though which index
    entry is to be represented

-   The [indexer prefers to use keywords]{style="color: blue;"} that [represents the subject
    clearly]{style="color: red;"} & [likely to be chosen by user]{style="color: blue;"} when looking for the subject

## Introduction (Cont.)

-   In order to [standardize the task of choosing appropriate keywords]{style="color: blue;"}
    for generation of index entries, [no. of vocabulary control devices]{style="color: red;"}
    have been developed such as thesaurus

-   [These tools help the indexer to choose most appropriate term]{style="color: blue;"} to
    represent the subject at indexing stage and help the users to pick
    most appropriate terms while formulating a query

-   [2 different indexers]{style="color: blue;"} may [analyse]{style="color: red;"} content of a [given document in 2
    different ways]{style="color: blue;"} resulting in [2 different index entries]{style="color: red;"} (**Serious
    Drawback of Manual Indexing**)

-   To avoid total dependence on human intellect, researchers have
    attempted to [automate]{style="color: blue;"} the whole process of subject indexing &
    classification

## Introduction (Cont.)

-   Most of the systems developed so far for [automatic content analysis]{style="color: blue;"}
    are [based on statistical calculation of occurrence of keywords]{style="color: red;"} in
    the documents

-   Given the [shortcomings of such statistically]{style="color: blue;"} based systems,
    researchers have suggested the [need of syntactic & semantic analysis]{style="color: red;"}
    of text statements by [using computational linguistics in the process
    of content analysis]{style="color: blue;"}

-   [Subject indexing systems have been classified]{style="color: blue;"} broadly as
    **pre-coordinate** and **post-coordinate** systems

-   In **post-coordinate** systems, [one entry is prepared for each
    keyword selected to represent the subject]{style="color: blue;"} of a given document and
    all entries are organized in a file



## Introduction (Cont.)
-   When a [user]{style="color: blue;"} puts forward a [query]{style="color: red;"}, it is [analyzed and some keywords
    are selected that are representative of user's query]{style="color: blue;"}. These [query
    terms are then matched against the file of index terms and relevant
    documents are retrieved]{style="color: red;"}. EG. Uniterm
-   In **pre-coordinate** systems, [keyword chosen at subject analysis
    stage]{style="color: blue;"} are coordinated at indexing stage and thus [each entry
    represents full content of the document]{style="color: red;"}. EG. PRECIS, POPSI,
    Chain Indexing, Relational Indexing



## Exhausitivity and Specificity (Cnt.)


-   [Effectiveness of an indexing system]{style="color: blue;"} is controlled by 2 parameters
    called **exhaustivity & term specificity**

-   [Exhaustivity]{style="color: blue;"} is the degree to which subject matter of a given
    document has been reflected through index entries. It [represents the
    contents of input documents fully]{style="color: blue;"}
-   To attain exhaustivity, system has to select [as many keywords as
    possible]{style="color: blue;"} to represent the idea put forward in the document

-   [Specificity refers to how broad or how specific are the terms]{style="color: blue;"} or
    keywords chosen under a given situation. More specific the terms,
    better is the representation of the subject through the index entry



## Exhausitivity and Specificity (Cnt.)

-   [Recall & Precision measure the effectiveness]{style="color: blue;"} of a systems where

-- Recall = No. of relevant documents retrieved / No. of relevant documents
in the collection

-- Precision = No. of relevant documents retrieved / Total no. of documents
retrieved

-   [More Exhaustivity]{style="color: blue;"}, [higher recall & lower precision]{style="color: red;"}

-   [More Specificity]{style="color: blue;"}, [higher precision & lower recall]{style="color: red;"}

## Theory of Indexing

- Some researchers like Quinn, Jones, and Fugmann suggested there are [5 levels in process of indexing]{style="color: blue;"}

- **First Level** is the [concordance]{style="color: blue;"}, which consists of [references to all words in original text arranged in alphabetical order]{style="color: red;"}

- **Second Level** is the information theoretic level which [calculates the likelihood of a word being chosen for indexing based on its frequency of occurrence in a given text document]{style="color: blue;"}

- **Third Level** is the [linguistic]{style="color: blue;"} one, which attempts to [explain how meaningful words are extracted from large units of text]{style="color: red"}. Some indexers propose that sections like opening paragraphs, chapters, sections, opening & 


## Theory of Indexing (Cnt.)

closing sentences of a paragraph are good sources of choosing indexing terms

- **Fourth Level** is the [textual or skeletal framework]{style="color: blue;"} where the [text is prepared by the author in an organized manner and held together by skeletal structure]{style="color: red;"}

- **Fifth Level** is the [inferential]{style="color: blue;"} level where [indexer make inferences about relationships between words and phrases by observing the sentences and paragraph structure]{style="color: red;"}

## Manual Indexing

![](images/indexing.png){fig-align="center"}

## Manual Indexing (Cnt.)

-   Effectiveness of an indexing system and the performance of total
    retrieval system depends on exhausivity & specificity of index terms

-   A no. of vocabulary control devised are available to guide indexer
    in choosing most appropriate index terms

-   For example, in [pre-coordnated systems like PRECIS use
    inbuilt/online thesaurus]{style="color: blue;"} and [POPSI uses classaurus]{style="color: red;"} (hierarchical
    classification incorporating all the features of a thesaurus)

-   In [post-coordinated systems]{style="color: blue;"}, after choosing the keywords, indexer
    has to put an index entry under [each term separately along with
    necessary reference entries ('see' & 'see also' entries)]{style="color: red;"}

## Pre-Coordinating Indexing Systems

**1. Chain Indexing**

-   Dr. **S.R Ranganathan** developed pre-coordinated indexing method called
    chain indexing

-   It attempts to [represent the chain of concepts]{style="color: blue;"} that constitutes a
    [subject in natural language]{style="color: blue;"} in contrast to the steps of classifying
    a document where we use artificial (notation) language for subject
    indexing

-   Thus, if we can represent subject in natural language and can
    represent all terms/concepts in chain forming the subject statement
    in a systematic manner, then [users can access subject matter by any
    of the constituent concepts]{style="color: blue;"}

## 1. Chain Indexing (Cnt.)

Basic steps in chain indexing are:

1.  [Take class no.]{style="color: blue;"} prepared for the given document
2.  Consult corresponding classification schedule and [write the
    notations at each step and the corresponding term]{style="color: blue;"} or phrase (from
    the schedule). This will produce a chain of concepts from general to
    specific
3.  [Identify the sought, unsought, and false links]{style="color: blue;"}
    -   **Sought links** denote the [concepts that user is likely to use]{style="color: blue;"} as
        access point
    -   **Unsought links** are those that are [not likely to be used as
        access points]{style="color: blue;"}

## 1. Chain Indexing (Cnt.)
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **False links** are those that are really [do not represent any valid
    concept]{style="color: blue;"} (mostly these are the connecting symbols)

4.  [Invert the chain]{style="color: blue;"} (process is called **reverse rendering**), and this
    will generate index entries

## 2. Relational Indexing
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **J.E.L. Farradane** devised a scheme of pre-coordinate indexing known as relational indexing

- It was [developed first in early 1950s]{style="color: blue;"} and has been modified several times since then. The latest changes were appeared in 1980

- Farradane identified [9 relational categories]{style="color: blue;"} which were represented in a 
:::



::: {.column width="50%"}

matrix


![](images/relational.png){fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## 2. Relational Indexing (Cnt.)

- [Any subject can be represented by identifying & representing in the form of what he called **analets** (pairs of terms interposed by an operator)]{style="color: blue;"}, [relationship between each pair of constituent concepts can be represented by the 9 relational operators]{style="color: red;"}

![](images/example2.png){fig-align="center"}

## 2. Relational Indexing (Cnt.)

![](images/eg.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/eg2.png){fig-align="center"}


## 3. PRECIS

- **PREserved Context Index System (PRECIS)** was developed by **Derek Austin** and first came out in **1974** and revised in 1984

- It became very popular and the major tasks involved in indexing in this system are:

    - [analysing]{style="color: blue;"} the concerned document and [identifying the key concepts]{style="color: blue;"}
    - [organizing the concepts into a subject statement based on principle of context dependency]{style="color: blue;"}
    - [assigning codes ('operators') which signify syntactical function of each term]{style="color: blue;"}
    - [deciding which terms should be the access points]{style="color: blue;"}
    
## 3. PRECIS (Cnt.)

- Major tasks:
    - and which should be in [other positions in index entries]{style="color: blue;"} and assigning further codes to achieve these results
    - [adding further prepositions, auxiliaries or phrases]{style="color: blue;"} which would result in [clarity and expressiveness]{style="color: red;"} of the resulting index entries
    - making [supporting reference entries from semantically related terms taken from a thesaurus]{style="color: blue;"}




## 3. PRECIS (Cnt.)
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- [Primary operators]{style="color: blue;"} (mainline operators) perform the [primary task in the syntactical side]{style="color: red;"}. There are [7 primary operator for 3 sets of concepts]{style="color: blue;"}
    - 0 is for 'environment of core concepts'
    - 1,2,3 are for 'core concepts'
    - 4,5,6 are for 'extra-core concepts'
    



:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/precis.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::
:::


## 3. PRECIS (Cnt.)
- Stages 2 to 4 deal with [syntactic relation]{style="color: blue;"} and are governed by 
    - [schema of role operators]{style="color: red;"}, and
    - [associated rules]{style="color: red;"} for dealing with each role operator and making index entries

- There are 2 kinds of operators: **primary** & **secondary** 

- There are 2 sets of **primary codes**: [one set (theme interlinks) involves 3 codes used to link common or related themes in the subject statement]{style="color: blue;"}

- [Other (term codes) involves 3 codes used to denote status of a term in subject statement]{style="color: red;"}

## 3. PRECIS (Cnt.)
- There are **secondary codes** which are divided into 2 sets

- First set is **differences** and it involves [3 kinds of differences]{style="color: blue;"} such as **'preceding differences', 'date as a difference' and 'parenthetical differences'**

- Second set involves **'connectives'** which are used to [connect any two or more consecutive terms in input string]{style="color: blue;"}

- There are some **typographic codes** which are used to bring desired typographic form of a given term in resulting index entry

## 3. PRECIS (Cnt.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Secondary operators** (interposed operators) perform [secondary functions]{style="color: blue;"} and are used for [3 sets of concepts]{style="color: red;"}: **f, g** are for ['coordinate concepts']{style="color: blue;"}; **p, q, r** are for ['dependent elements']{style="color: blue;"}; **s, t, u** are for ['special classes for action']{style="color: blue;"}
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
- Example of PRECIS entries:

*Subject statement*: Management of libraries in India

Entries:

- **Management**
    -  Libraries. India
        
- **Libraries**. Management

  -  India
      
-  **India**. Libraries. Management
:::

## 4. POPSI

- **POstulated-based Permuted Subject Indexing (POPSI)** is a pre-coordinated indexing system developed by **G. Bhattacharyya**

- It uses [analytico-synthetic method  for string formulation]{style="color: blue;"} and permutation of constituent terms to satisfy different approach points to document

- There are [2 parts in POPSI index entry]{style="color: blue;"}
  
  - **Lead Heading** which contains [index term or access term ]{style="color: blue;"}
  - **Context Heading** which [appears in line following lead heading]{style="color: blue;"} & [contains subject words with auxiliary words]{style="color: red;"} denoting the context in which lead term has been discussed in given document


## 4. POPSI (Cnt.)

- He proposed [4 elementary categories]{style="color: blue;"}, **discipline, entity, property, ** and **action** (DEPA in short) and a [special component called modifier]{style="color: blue;"}

- Accd. to POPSI, a **discipline** is an [elementary category which includes conventional fields of study]{style="color: blue;"} or [any aggregate of such fields]{style="color: blue;"} or artificially created analogous fields such as physics, library science, computer science

- **Entity** includes [manifestations having perceptual correlates, or only a conceptual existence, and distinct from properties and actions performed by them or on them]{style="color: blue;"}. EG. patent, lung, plant, so on

## 4. POPSI (Cnt.)

- **Property** includes [manifestations denoting concept or attribute - qualitative or quantitative]{style="color: blue;"}. EG. specific gravity, disease, efficiency, so on

- **Action** includes [manifestations denoting concept of doing, either as self action or as external action]{style="color: blue;"}. EG. evaluation, examination, migration

- In relation to manifestation of any one of the elementary categories the [modifiers qualifies the manifestations without disturbing their conceptual wholeness]{style="color: blue;"}. EG. 'subject' in 'subject classification'

- A [modifier can modify any of the fundamental categories]{style="color: blue;"} or a [combination]{style="color: blue;"} of fundamental categories


## 4. POPSI (Cnt.)

- Modifiers can be [common modifiers]{style="color: red;"} like [form, time, environment, and place, and special modifiers, which are discipline-based, property-based or action-based]{style="color: blue;"}

- Basic rule of syntax is associated with deep structure of a subject indexing language is that discipline should be followed by entity appropriately interpolated or extrapolated wherever warranted by property and/or action

- There are other rules that govern syntactical structure of POPSI such as

  - manifestation of property follows immediately the manifestation in relation to which it is a property

## 4. POPSI (Cnt.)

- manifestation of action follows immediately the manifestation in relation to which it is an action

- property & action can have another property and/or action directly related

- species or part follows immediately the manifestation in relation to which it is a species (genus-species relation such as Flower and Rose) or part (whole-part relation, such as Human Body & Lungs)

- modifier follows immediately the manifestation in relation to which it is a modifier

## 4. POPSI (Cnt.)

![](images/popsi.png){fig-align="center"}

## Post-Coordinate Indexing Systems

**1. Uniterm**

- Uniterm was developed by Mortimer Taube in 1953 

- It is a simple post-coordinate indexing system

- It creates index entries for each unit term identified by the indexer

- The term is posted on top of card and the card is divided into 10 columns, 0 to 9

- Document no. (i.e. accession no. or no. of given document being indexed) is written on the card by a technique called 'terminal digital posting' - no. written in a column based on right-most digit in document no.

## 1. Uniterm
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Fig. shows entries for 2 subjects: automation of libraries in India (document no. 13) and management of libraries in England (document no. 45) 

- During searching, user has to pick up all the cards related to his/her search request and has to identify those numbers that appear in all the cards



:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/uniterm.png){fig-align="center"}
- Process of comparing no. is quite difficult specially for large collection of documents 

:::
:::

## 2. Optical Coincidence/Peek-a-Boo Cards

- It was devised to overcome the manual searching problem of uniterm 

- It is based on a simple principle: each card is divided into small units of numbered squares, each unit bearing a specific no. and a document no. is punched on appropriate position on the card

- Thus no. of small holes are produced on each card, each hole representing a particular document no. in which the term, written on top of the card appears

- During searching, user has to pick up all the cards matching a given query. Cards are then placed in a box


## 2. Optical Coincidence/Peek-a-Boo Cards

 against source of light. Light will pass thorough those cards that have punched at the same position

- No. represented by these positions will contain all the terms present in the query and thus will be the output

- A peek-a-boo card contains space at the top of heading for posting of a term/phrase like a Uniterm card, and the body of the card is divided up to into numbered squares ranging from 500 to 1000 or upto 10,000

- This system removed some problem by Uniterm cards but if there were a large no. of punches on card, it could easily become  mutilated after being used a no. of times


## Automatic Indexing

- In LIS 'Automatic Indexing' is interchangeably used used with term 'computerized indexing'

- Use of computer in generating indexes of documents started from KWIC indexing developed by H.P.Luhn

- Keyword indexing system was originally developed by Andrea Crestadoro in 1956 under name 'Keywords in Titles' which was revised later to **Keyword-in-Context (KWIC)** in 1958

- Each entry in KWIC index consists of 3 parts:

**a) Keywords**: Subj. denoting words which serve as approach terms

## Automatic Indexing (Cnt.)

**b) Context**: Keywords that specify particular context of document (rest of terms of the title)

**c) Identification or Location Code**: Code used (serial no. of entries in main part) to provide address of document where full bibliographic description of document will be available

- No. of varieties of keyword index are there in literature which differ in terms of their formats but indexing techniques & principles remain more or less same such as:

**1. KWOC (Key-Word Out-Of-Context) Index** where each keyword is taken out & printed separately in left hand 

## Automatic Indexing (Cnt.)

margin with complete title in its normal order printed to the right

**2. KWAC (Key-Word Augmented-in-Context) Index** provides enrichment of keywords of title with additional keywords taken either from abstract or from original text of document and are inserted into title or added at the end to give further index entries


**3. KWWC (Key-Word-With-Context) Index** where part of title relevant to keyword is considered as entry term

**4. KEYTALPHA (Key-Term Alphabetical) Index** is a permuted subject index that lists only keywords assigned to each abstract

## Automatic Indexing (Cnt.)


**5. WADEX (Word & Author Index)** is an improved version of KWIC index where names of authors are also treated as keywords in addition to significant subject term and thus facilitates to satisfy author approach of documents

**6. DKWTC (Double KWIC) Index** is another improved version of KWIC index 

**7. KLIC (Key-Letter-In-Context) Index** allows truncation of word either in beginning or at the end where a fragment can be specified and computer can pick up any term containing that fragment

# Metadata {background-color="#438496"}

## Metadata

- 'Data which describes attributes of a resource'

- 'Meaningful data describing another discrete data object'

- 'Data associated with objects which relieves their potential users of having to have full advance knowledge of their existence or characteristics


#### Types of Metadata

**A. Descriptive Metadata**: It is used to describe a document.To locate & identify documents, it is very imp. element. Field 856 in MARC, Call No. in Catalogue Card, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in web document all act as location identifier liker  *IDENTIFIER* in Dublin Core Metadata. It helps to distinguish version & curatorial info. of documents

## Types of Metadata (Cnt.)

**B. Structural Metadata**: It describes internal organization. Physical files and structure of logical objects are connected through structural metadata

**C. Administrative Metadata**: It provides info. designed for management of resources. During the creation of a document, the info. generated along the process which become integral part of the document is regarded as admin. metadata such as Ordering, Acquisition, Maintenance, Licensing, Rights, Ownership, Provenance

**D. Rights Management Metadata**: It is related to IPR which ensure that material is distributed correctly and rightful compensation is given to rights holder 

## Types of Metadata (Cnt.)

**E. Preservation Metadata**: It is used for 'digital longevity'. Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies or PREMIS is an example of standard metadata used in digital preservation. OCLC & Research Library Group built the PREMIS

**F. Technical Metadata**: It is used to keep info. regarding software & hardware. technical info. on digitization (file, format, size, type, date of creation, compression scheme, security, etc.). 


## Dublin Core Metadata

- Dublin Core Metadata Workshop Series began in 1995 to develop discovery standards for electronic resources


- The first meeting took place in Dublin, Ohio and gave rise to metadata format called Dublin Core

- It has 15-element set of descriptors intended to promote author-generated description of internet resources

- It falls into 3 groups which indicate the class/scope of info. stored in them

- Elements related to *content of resources; resources when viewed as IP; instantiation of resources*

## Dublin Core Metadata (Cnt.)

![](images/dublin.png){fig-align="center"}

## Dublin Core Metadata (Cnt.)

- [Dublin Core Metadata Editor](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/) is a service that retrieves a given webpage and automatically generate Dublin Core metadata 

- It also allows users to edit the tags or add or edit contents 

- Following are the Dublin Core standard characteristics:

   - Core set can be extended with further elements for a particular domain
  - All elements are optional
  - All elements are repeatable
  - Any element may be modified by a qualifier

# Data Mining {background-color="#438496"}

## Data Mining

- Every day an exponential amount of data is being generated over the Internet
- For several years, advances in knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) have been
undertaken to manage the information in an efficient manner

- Data mining is a part of the KDD process, which identifies the hidden patterns in large information
repositories
- It involves several information extraction techniques, such as regression
models, association rules, Bayesian methods, decision trees, neural networks,
etc.

## Data Mining Process

![](images/dm.png){fig-align="center"}

## Data Mining Process (Cnt.)

**1. Problem Identification**: Objectives of a research problem are identified

**2. Pre-processing**: Data is being prepared for pattern extraction where the raw text
is transformed into some data representation format that can be used as input for
the knowledge extraction algorithms

**3. Pattern Extraction**: Suitable algorithm to extract the hidden patterns is applied.
The algorithm is chosen based on the data available and the type of pattern that
is expected

**4. Post-processing**: Extracted knowledge is evaluated in this step

## Data Mining Process (Cnt.)

**5. Knowledge Usage**: If the knowledge from the post-processing step meets the
process objectives, it is put available to the users. Otherwise, another cycle is
performed, making changes in the data preparation activities and/or in pattern
extraction parameters

## Data Harvesting

- It refers to collecting & analyzing large amount of data from various sources such as social media, website

- It aims to extract valuable insights & info. that can be used to make informed decisions & improve business operations
