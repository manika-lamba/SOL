# THESAURUS - History, Definition{background-color="#438496"}

## INTRODUCTION

-   [Efficiency of an IR system depends on the indexing language used]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Its capability to [handle 2 fundamentally different but
    interdependent types of relationship between the terms]{style="color: blue;"} used to
    represent the subject content of the document

-   Thesaurus has mainly been conceived in the context of
    [post-coordinate indexing system]{style="color: blue;"} but it can be used for
    pre-coordinated system as well

-   The word 'Thesaurus' is of Greek origin, literally meaning [*treasury
    or storehouse of knowledge*]{style="color: blue;"}

-   But in modern usage, it denotes [a list of terms arranges according
    to their relationship of ideas]{style="color: blue;"}

## DEFINITION

-   "A thesaurus may be defined either in terms of its function or its
    structure. In terms of function, a thesaurus is a terminological
    control device used in translating from the natural language of
    documents, indexers or users into a more constrained *system
    language* (documentation language, information language). In terms
    of structure, a thesaurus is a controlled and dynamic vocabulary of
    a controlled and dynamic vocabulary of semantically and generically
    related terms which covers a specific domain of knowledge"

## DEFINITION (Cont.)

-   "A compilation of words and phrases showing synonymous,
    hierarchical, and other relationships and dependencies, the function
    of which is to provide a standardized vocabulary for information
    storage and retrieval"
-   "A controlled vocabulary arranges in a known order in which
    equivalence, homographic, hierarchical, and associative
    relationships among terms are clearly displayed and identified by
    standardized relationship indicator, which must be employed
    reciprocally"

## DEFINITION (Cont.)

A thesaurus in the field of information storage and retrieval [is a list
of terms and/or of other signs (or symbols) indicating relationships
among these elements]{style="color: blue;"}, provided that the following criteria hold:

(i) the list contains a [significant proportion of non-preferred terms
    and/or of preferred terms not used as descriptors]{style="color: blue;"};

(ii) [terminological control]{style="color: blue;"} is intended.

## HISTORY

-   [Peter Mark Roget]{style="color: blue;"} first conceived the idea of
    such compilation and brought out this **Thesaurus of English words
    and Phrases** in **1852** for the benefit of writers for looking for
    appropriate words to express their ideas

-   [Helen Brownson]{style="color: blue;"} is said to be the first
    person who used the term *'Thesaurus'* in the context of IR in a
    paper presented in **1957** at the [Dorking Conference in
    Classification Research]{.underline}

-   [Hans P. Luhn]{style="color: blue;"} was possible the first person
    to think in terms of [*'Information Retrieval
    Thesaurus'*]{.underline}

-   The first Thesaurus used in an IR system was developed by [Du Pont
    in US around 1959]{style="color: blue;"}

# STRUCTURE & RELATIONSHIP {background-color="#438496"}

## STRUCTURE & RELATIONSHIP

![](images/structure.png)

## BASIC THESAURAS RELATIONSHIP

![](images/relationship.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## A. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONSHIP

::: panel-tabset
## Introduction

-   It is the relationship between preferred & non-preferred terms where
    2 or more terms are regarded for indexing purposes as referring to
    the same concept

-   It is denoted by USE and UF

-   It includes [*synonyms, lexical variants, quasi-synonyms,* & *upward
    posting*]{style="color: blue;"}

## Synonyms

## Quasi-synonyms

![](images/quasi.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Upward Posting

![](images/posting.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::

## B. HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP

-   This relationship shows level of super-ordination and sub-ordination

-   It is used in locating broader and narrower concepts in a logically
    progressive sequence

-   The relationship is reciprocal and is set out in a thesaurus using
    following conventions:

    -   **BT**(BROADER TERM)
    -   **NT**(NARROWER TERM)

-   It includes *generic relationship, hierarchical whole-part
    relationship, instance relationship, & polyhierarchical
    relationship*

## B. HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP

::: panel-tabset
## Generic/Species

-   It identifies the link between a class or category and its members
    or species

-   It is also known as Inclusion Relationship

-   EG.: VERTEBRATA

    -   **NT** Amphilblia
        -   Mammalia
        -   Aves
        -   Pisces
        -   Reptilia

## Whole-Part

![](images/whole.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

## Instance

-   This relationship is between a general category of things and
    events, expressed by a common noun, and an individual instance of
    that category, the instance then forming a class of one which is
    represented by a proper name

-   EG.: SEAS

    -   **NT** Baltic Sea

        -   Caspian Sea

        -   Mediterranean Sea
:::

## B. HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP

::: panel-tabset
## Poly-Hierarchical

-   It is the relationship between the term & its 2 or more
    super-ordinate terms

-   Some terms may belong to more than one hierarchy and consequently
    maybe related to more than one broader term & more than one set of
    narrower terms

-   EG.: Mamalia ---Whale---Marine Animals
:::

## C. ASSOCIATIVE RELATIONSHIP

::: panel-tabset
## Introduction

-   This relationship is found between terms which are closely related
    conceptually but not hierarchically and are not members of an
    equivalence set

-   The relation is reciprocal, and is distinguished by the abbreviation
    "RT" (Related Terms)

-   EG. TEACHING

    -   RT Teaching aids

-   TEACHING AIDS

    -   RT Teaching

## Intro. (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Two types of associative relationship:

1.  Terms belonging to the same category (e.g., motorcycle / bicycle)

2.  Terms belonging to different categories
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
    1. Whole-part (e.g., buildings / doors)
    2. A discipline and the objects studied (e.g., ethnography / primitive societies)
    3. An operation or process and the agent or instrument (e.g., motor racing / racing cars)
    4. An occupation and the person in that occupation (e.g., accountancy / accountants)
    5. An action and the product of the action (e.g., publishing / music scores)
    6. An action and its patient (e.g., data analysis / data)
    7. Concepts related to their properties (e.g., women / femininity)
    8. Concepts linked by causal dependence (e.g., injury / accidents)
    9. A thing or action and its counter-agent (e.g., pests / pesticides)
    10. A raw material and its product
    11. An action and a property associated with it (e.g., precision measurement / accuracy)
    12. A concept and its opposite (e.g., single people / married people)

# THESAUROFACET {background-color="#438496"}

## THESAUROFACET

-   The concept was developed by **Jean Aitchison** in *1969*

-   It is a multipurpose retrieval language tool

-   It consists of 2 sections:

a.  Faceted Classification
b.  Alphabetical Subject Index

# FORMAT OF IR THESAURUS {background-color="#438496"}

## FORMAT OF IR THESAURUS

-   An IR thesaurus may be arranged and presented in one or more of the
    following methods:

1.  **Alphabetical** - in which descriptors and cross references are
    arranged in alphabetical order

2.  **Systematic or Classified** - in which descriptors are arranged in
    their hierarchical order with level of hierarchy represented by
    indentions, dashes, dots, etc.

3.  **Graphic** -- in which the hierarchy is shown by a tree or an
    arrowgraph

## ESSENTIAL STEPS

![](images/steps.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

# ADVANTAGES OF THESAURUS {background-color="#438496"}

## ADVANTAGES

-   It effects vocabulary control in the language being used in IR
-   It helps an indexer in selecting preferred terms
-   It provides more access points
-   It enables the searcher to find out not only information on a
    specific topic, but also, on all related topics
-   By using indexing terms and search terms from the same thesaurus,
    the speed of retrieval can be increased
-   It helps in obtaining high recall ratio & high precision ratio in
    information search
