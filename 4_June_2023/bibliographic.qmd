# Bibliographic Description - Introduction {background-color="#438496"}

## INTRODUCTION

-   Unprecedented growth of literature gives rise to develop adequate
    formats with standard bibliographic description to promote resource
    sharing among libraries and to have effective information retrieval
    system

-   The library scenario has been completely changed with the
    application ICT rendered the traditional manual oriented
    bibliographic description standards inadequate paved the way for
    newer bibliographic standards

-   Moreover, the fast growth of International Bibliographic Exchange
    Formats and lack of compatibility poses problems to exchange records
    with one another

-   It is possible if each of the organizations agree upon a common
    standard format for exchange purpose to be

## INTRODUCTION (Cont.)

-   achieved at National and International level

-   In this age of Information flood and the advent of IT era, it is
    very difficult to locate and retrieve the desired information

-   Hence it is necessary that the efficient information retrieval
    system must have a format of bibliographic description that matches
    its requirements

-   A bibliographic format in such a way to be redesigned so as to make
    it most compatible with the new information environment for
    international library resource sharing, international library loan
    and global networking with the aid of ICT

## INTRODUCTION (Cont.)

-   The bibliographic description in a process of recording the items of
    information about the document for easy identification and instant
    location, access and for the purpose of effective dissemination

-   IFLA held an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles
    (ICCP) at Paris in 1961 with a purpose to achieve international
    standardization in cataloguing

-   Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic Description
    (ISBD) made it economic & technological necessity for the creation,
    conversion, and use of machine-readable records

-   These rules are standards to promote universal bibliographic control

## INTRODUCTION (Cont.)

-   Consistency while sharing bibliographic information is the main goal
    of ISBD

-   The most important contribution has been made by ISBD(G) \[General
    International Standard Bibliographic Description\] which is intended
    to provide the generalized framework for descriptive information
    required in range of different bibliographic activities

## FIVE PHASES IN DEVELOPMENT OF ISBD

1.  Creating a draft text

2.  Worldwide Review

3.  Final Revision

4.  Balloting

5.  Publication

## STRUCTURE OF ISBD

-   ISBD is divided into 8 areas on description

1.  Title and statement of responsibility
2.  Edition
3.  Material (or type of Publication) specific data (used for
    cartographic materials & serials)
4.  Publication, distribution data, including place & date of
    Publication
5.  Physical description
6.  Series
7.  Notes
8.  Standard number & terms of availability

## PURPOSE OF ISBD

-   It makes it possible to interchange records from different sources

-   It supports to overcome the language barriers and help to interpret
    records from one language to other

-   It facilitates the conversion of bibliographic records to electronic
    form

-   It defines the selection and order of data elements

-   It prescribes punctuation marks to be used within a bibliography

-   It establishes compatibility among cataloging for exchange of
    bibligraphic records for information centers

# Bibliographic Description - Scope, Evolution {background-color="#438496"}

## SCOPE OF BIBLIO. DES.

::: panel-tabset
## Scope

-   It should focus on proper functionality of bibliographic records
    maintained by libraries & information centers

-   The scope of bibliographic description can be in the *context of
    coverage, user, application and generic tasks associated with it*

1.  *Coverage Bibliographic Description* should be comprehensive in
    terms of variety of materials (textual, musical, cartographic,
    audio-visual, graphic, 3-D material, etc.). It must cover physical
    media (film, magnetic storage devices) and all formats (books,

## Scope (Cont.)

sheets discs, cassettes, etc) all with all modes of recording (analogue,
acoustic, digital, etc)

2.  *Users Bibliographic Description* ensure the use of bibliographic
    records by wide range of users. The user groups included readers,
    students, researchers, library staff, publishers, distribution &
    subscription such as information brokers, retailers, agents, etc

3.  *Applications of Bibliographic Description* in relation to
    bibliographic records should support a wide variety of data &
    bibliographic records. It includes *collection development,
    acquisition, cataloging, production of*

## Scope (Cont.)

*finding aids & bibliographies, inventory management, preservation,
circulation, ILL, reference & information retrieval*

4.  *Tasks Bibliographic Description* should fulfill the functional
    requirements for bibliographic records. It must allow users' to
    perform all the generic tasks at the time of searching and making
    use of bibliographic records. This include **finding, identifying,
    selecting, & acquiring** material using bibliographic data

## Scope (Cont.)

-   Cataloguers perform the following tasks to maintain the catalogues
    or bibliograhic databases:

    -   Transcribe
    -   Describe
    -   Make Identifiable
    -   Link
    -   Manage
    -   Convey Rights Management Information

## EVOLUTION

::: panel-tabset
## Intro

-   The standards, rules and principles of bibliographic description are
    also applicable to online and web environment for discovery,
    indexing and identification of digital resources by semantic means

-   Metadata schemas for describing electronic resources (such as Dublin
    Core, FGDC, GILS, etc.), like traditional bibliographic standards
    and formats, are also designed for information storage and transfer

-   It means that a bibliographic record now performs different
    functions with respect to various media, various applications, and
    various user needs

## Intro (Cont.)

-   This situation calls for a framework that should identify and
    clearly define bibliographic entities, attributes, relationships and
    tasks performed by users of bibliographic records

-   Some conceptual models (such as IFLA's FRBR model, UKOLN's
    Analytical Model of Collection Description and XOBIS model of
    Stanford University) have been developed in recent years to
    encompass a broad-spectrum application of bibliographic description
    and use of bibliographic records

## Pre-ISBD

![](images/pre-isbd.png){fig-align="center" width="58%"}

## Pre-ISBD(Cont.)

-   During this period the much-required agreed-to general format for
    bibliographic description could not be developed

-   IFLA first initiated the development of such a general format in the
    form of ISBD(G) under its Universal Bibliographic Control (UBC)
    program
:::

## EVOLUTION

::: panel-tabset
## Ranganathan's Principles

-   Ranganathan applied scientific method to cataloguing & formulated
    normative principles of cataloguing called Canons of Cataloguing

-   These principles still serve as the basis for principles and rules
    of bibliographic description vis-a-vis cataloguing codes

-   The general principles for standards for biblio. descrp. are:

1.  *Principle of Context*: It determines the situational contexts
    required for specifying the elements of

## Principles (Cont.)

bibliographic description and their role

2.  *Principle of Permanence*: It says no element in an entry, the
    heading in particular, should be subjected to change unless rules
    themselves are changed in response to the principle of context
3.  *Principle of Consistency*: It says bibliographic description should
    be consistent for bibliographic records
4.  *Principle of Unity of Idea*: It advocates structural design for
    cataloguing codes and standards for bibliographic description

# Bibliographic Description - Format {background-color="#438496"}

## Bibliographic Format

::: panel-tabset
## Intro

-   Bibliographic formats have been created for two purposes -- to
    facilitate search and retrieval of bibliographic records, locally
    and in network environment and to exchange bibliographic information
    among library and information centers

-   A bibliographic format that acts as a means of exchanging data has
    three basic components:

1.  **Physical structure:** Rules to arrange the data to be exchanged on
    a computer storage medium such as CD. etc. ISO 2709 is an accepted
    international standard for

## Compo. (Cont.)

exchange of bibliographic data on magnetic tape and other storage media

2.  **Content Designators:** Tags to define the different data elements
    of the records such as author, date of publication, title, so on.
    EG. MARC family (USMARC, CANMARC, UKMARC, UNIMARC, INDIMARC,
    MARC21 - combination of USMARC & CANMARC), CCF (Common Communication
    Format), others

3.  **Content:** Rules & record that helps in formulation of data
    elements for different formats. EG. catalogue codes, ISBD

## Electronic Resource

-   ISBD(ER) provides a long list of data elements for describing
    electronic resources & AARC2 guide the cataloguing of such resources

-   Some bibliographic formats are UNIMARC, MARC21 developed special
    field (Field 856) for managing electronic resources

-   Bibliographic formats & cataloguing codes are not enough for
    representing all unique characterstics of digital resources and
    therefore metadata standards have been developed as *resource
    description schemas*
:::

## Bibliographic Format (Cont.)

::: panel-tabset
## Metadata

-   Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates
    or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage digital
    information resources

-   Metadata schemas are sets of metadata elements designed for a
    particular purpose, for example to describe a particular type of
    information resource

-   In addition to resource discovery, metadata schemas can help to
    organise electronic resource, facilitate interoperability & resource
    integration, support digital identification and ensure archiving and
    preservation

## Metadata (Cont.)

-   Many different metadata schemas are being used in library
    environment
    -   Dublin Core Metadata Schema: describe web based documents.
        Dublin Core is a set of 15 main elements that fall into three
        groups -- Contents, Intellectual Property and Instantiation.
    -   Global Information Locator Service (GILS): GILS specifies a
        profile of the Z39.50 protocol for search and retrieval. GILS
        records are intended to describe aggregates such as catalogues,
        publishing services and databases.

## Metadata (Cont.)

-   Text Encoding Initiative (TEI): It is a scheme for marking up
    electronic text. It also specifies a header portion to accommodate
    metadata about the object to be described. TEI headers can be used
    to record bibliographic information of both electronic and
    non-electronic sources

-   Online Information Exchange International (ONIX): ONIX is an
    XML-based metadata schema developed for publishing industry to
    response enormous growth in online books sales. It records basic
    bibliographic data along with trade data and promotional information

## Models (Cont.)

-   FRBR model:
    -   identifies the bibliographic entities and defines their nature

    -   analyses the attributes associated with each of the entities
    -   provides a comprehensive listing of individual data elements
        associated with each attribute

        generalized level between specific instances of entities
    

## Models (Cont.)

-   FRBR model:
    -   maps the attributes and relationships associated with each
        entity to four generic user tasks (**find, identify, select, obtain**) 
    - recommends basic data requirements for national
bibliographic records
