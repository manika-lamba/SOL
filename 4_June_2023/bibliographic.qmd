# Bibliographic Description - Introduction {background-color="#438496"}

## INTRODUCTION

-   Unprecedented growth of literature gives rise to develop adequate
    formats with standard bibliographic description to promote resource
    sharing among libraries and to have effective information retrieval
    system

-   The library scenario has been completely changed with the
    application ICT rendered the traditional manual oriented
    bibliographic description standards inadequate paved the way for
    newer bibliographic standards

-   Moreover, the fast growth of International Bibliographic Exchange
    Formats and lack of compatibility poses problems to exchange records
    with one another

-   It is possible if each of the organizations agree upon a common
    standard format for exchange purpose to be

## INTRODUCTION (Cont.)

achieved at National and International level

-   In this age of Information flood and the advent of IT era, it is
    very difficult to locate and retrieve the desired information

-   Hence it is necessary that the efficient information retrieval
    system must have a format of bibliographic description that matches
    its requirements

-   A bibliographic format in such a way to be redesigned so as to make
    it most compatible with the new information environment for
    international library resource sharing, international library loan
    and global networking with the aid of ICT

## INTRODUCTION (Cont.)

-   The bibliographic description in a process of recording the items of
    information about the document for easy identification and instant
    location, access and for the purpose of effective dissemination

-   IFLA held an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles
    (ICCP) at Paris in 1961 with a purpose to achieve international
    standardization in cataloguing

-   Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic Description
    (ISBD) made it economic & technological necessity for the creation,
    conversion, and use of machine-readable records

-   These rules are standards to promote universal bibliographic control



# Bibliographic Description - Scope, Evolution {background-color="#438496"}

## SCOPE OF BIBLIO. DES.

::: panel-tabset
## Scope

-   It should focus on proper functionality of bibliographic records
    maintained by libraries & information centers

-   The scope of bibliographic description can be in the *context of
    coverage, user, application and generic tasks associated with it*

1.  *Coverage Bibliographic Description* should be comprehensive in
    terms of variety of materials (textual, musical, cartographic,
    audio-visual, graphic, 3-D material, etc.). It must cover physical
    media (film, magnetic storage devices) and all formats (books,

## Scope (Cont.)

sheets discs, cassettes, etc) all with all modes of recording (analogue,
acoustic, digital, etc)

2.  *Users Bibliographic Description* ensure the use of bibliographic
    records by wide range of users. The user groups included readers,
    students, researchers, library staff, publishers, distribution &
    subscription such as information brokers, retailers, agents, etc

3.  *Applications of Bibliographic Description* in relation to
    bibliographic records should support a wide variety of data &
    bibliographic records. It includes *collection development,
    acquisition, cataloging, production of*

## Scope (Cont.)

*finding aids & bibliographies, inventory management, preservation,
circulation, ILL, reference & information retrieval*

4.  *Tasks Bibliographic Description* should fulfill the functional
    requirements for bibliographic records. It must allow users' to
    perform all the generic tasks at the time of searching and making
    use of bibliographic records. This include **finding, identifying,
    selecting, & acquiring** material using bibliographic data

## Scope (Cont.)

-   Cataloguers perform the following tasks to maintain the catalogues
    or bibliograhic databases:

    -   Transcribe
    -   Describe
    -   Make Identifiable
    -   Link
    -   Manage
    -   Convey Rights Management Information
:::

## EVOLUTION

::: panel-tabset
## Intro

-   The standards, rules and principles of bibliographic description are
    also applicable to online and web environment for discovery,
    indexing and identification of digital resources by semantic means

-   Metadata schemas for describing electronic resources (such as Dublin
    Core, FGDC, GILS, etc.), like traditional bibliographic standards
    and formats, are also designed for information storage and transfer

-   It means that a bibliographic record now performs different
    functions with respect to various media, various applications, and
    various user needs

## Intro (Cont.)

-   This situation calls for a framework that should identify and
    clearly define bibliographic entities, attributes, relationships and
    tasks performed by users of bibliographic records

-   Some conceptual models (such as IFLA's FRBR model, UKOLN's
    Analytical Model of Collection Description and XOBIS model of
    Stanford University) have been developed in recent years to
    encompass a broad-spectrum application of bibliographic description
    and use of bibliographic records

## Pre-ISBD

![](images/pre-isbd.png){fig-align="center" width="58%"}

## Pre-ISBD(Cont.)

-   During this period the much-required agreed-to general format for
    bibliographic description could not be developed

-   IFLA first initiated the development of such a general format in the
    form of ISBD(G) under its Universal Bibliographic Control (UBC)
    program
:::

## EVOLUTION

::: panel-tabset
## Ranganathan's Principles

-   Ranganathan applied scientific method to cataloguing & formulated
    normative principles of cataloguing called Canons of Cataloguing

-   These principles still serve as the basis for principles and rules
    of bibliographic description vis-a-vis cataloguing codes

-   The general principles for standards for biblio. descrp. are:

1.  *Principle of Context*: It determines the situational contexts
    required for specifying the elements of

## Principles (Cont.)

bibliographic description and their role

2.  *Principle of Permanence*: It says no element in an entry, the
    heading in particular, should be subjected to change unless rules
    themselves are changed in response to the principle of context
3.  *Principle of Consistency*: It says bibliographic description should
    be consistent for bibliographic records
4.  *Principle of Unity of Idea*: It advocates structural design for
    cataloguing codes and standards for bibliographic description
:::

## RULES

::: panel-tabset

## Rules

- AACR2 adopted standards of ISBD for construction of catalogues of different types of materials and different sizes of libraries

- ISBD defines 2 functions
    - Levels of Bibliographic Description
    - Specification of Data Elements

## Rules (Cont.)

1. **Levels of Bibliographic Description**  

- ISBD prescribes 8 areas of info. to be provided in cataloging but not all elements are necessary for cataloging every single document

- It depends on the size of the library and info. needed to describe a particular document

- AACR2 in its 0.26 Rules emphasized that "certain materials do not require every element of that standard"

- Levels are provided to "constitute a max. set of info."

# Bibliographic Description - Format {background-color="#438496"}

## Bibliographic Format

::: panel-tabset
## Intro

-   Bibliographic formats have been created for two purposes -- to
    facilitate search and retrieval of bibliographic records, locally
    and in network environment and to exchange bibliographic information
    among library and information centers

-   A bibliographic format that acts as a means of exchanging data has
    three basic components:

1.  **Physical structure:** Rules to arrange the data to be exchanged on
    a computer storage medium such as CD. etc. ISO 2709 is an accepted
    international standard for

## Compo. (Cont.)

exchange of bibliographic data on magnetic tape and other storage media

2.  **Content Designators:** Tags to define the different data elements
    of the records such as author, date of publication, title, so on.
    EG. MARC family (USMARC, CANMARC, UKMARC, UNIMARC, INDIMARC,
    MARC21 - combination of USMARC & CANMARC), CCF (Common Communication
    Format), others

3.  **Content:** Rules & record that helps in formulation of data
    elements for different formats. EG. catalogue codes, ISBD

## Electronic Resource

-   ISBD(ER) provides a long list of data elements for describing
    electronic resources & AARC2 guide the cataloguing of such resources

-   Some bibliographic formats are UNIMARC, MARC21 developed special
    field (Field 856) for managing electronic resources

-   Bibliographic formats & cataloguing codes are not enough for
    representing all unique characterstics of digital resources and
    therefore metadata standards have been developed as *resource
    description schemas*
:::

## Bibliographic Format (Cont.)

::: panel-tabset
## Metadata

-   Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates
    or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage digital
    information resources

-   Metadata schemas are sets of metadata elements designed for a
    particular purpose, for example to describe a particular type of
    information resource

-   In addition to resource discovery, metadata schemas can help to
    organise electronic resource, facilitate interoperability & resource
    integration, support digital identification and ensure archiving and
    preservation

## Metadata (Cont.)

-   Many different metadata schemas are being used in library
    environment
    -   Dublin Core Metadata Schema: describe web based documents.
        Dublin Core is a set of 15 main elements that fall into three
        groups -- Contents, Intellectual Property and Instantiation.
    -   Global Information Locator Service (GILS): GILS specifies a
        profile of the Z39.50 protocol for search and retrieval. GILS
        records are intended to describe aggregates such as catalogues,
        publishing services and databases.

## Metadata (Cont.)

-   Text Encoding Initiative (TEI): It is a scheme for marking up
    electronic text. It also specifies a header portion to accommodate
    metadata about the object to be described. TEI headers can be used
    to record bibliographic information of both electronic and
    non-electronic sources

-   Online Information Exchange International (ONIX): ONIX is an
    XML-based metadata schema developed for publishing industry to
    response enormous growth in online books sales. It records basic
    bibliographic data along with trade data and promotional information

## Models of Biblio. Descrp.

::: panel-tabset
## FRBR

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is an entity-relationship model framed by IFLA in 1998

-   It represents a generalised view of the bibliographic universe
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/frbr.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## FRBR (Cont.)

-   FRBR model:
    -   identifies the bibliographic entities and defines their nature
        and scope
    -   analyses the attributes associated with each of the entities
    -   provides a comprehensive listing of individual data elements
        associated with each attribute
    -   delineates the nature of relationships that operate at a
        generalized level between specific instances of entities

## FRBR (Cont.)

-   FRBR model:
    -   maps the attributes and relationships associated with each
        entity to four generic user tasks (**find, identify, select,
        obtain**)
    -   recommends basic data requirements for national bibliographic
        records
:::

## Models of Biblio. Descrp.

::: panel-tabset
## FRBR (Cont.)

-   FRBR Entities:
    -   Group 1 are the products of intellectual and artistic endeavor
        that are named or described in bibliographic records : work,
        expression, manifestation, and item

![](images/frbr2.png){fig-align="center"}

## FRBR (Cont.)

-   Group 1 are the entities that are the product of intellectual or
    artistic endeavor

![](images/frbr5.png){fig-align="center"}

## FRBR (Cont.)

-   Group 1
    -   Work: distinct intellectual or artistic creation
    -   Expression: intellectual or artistic realization of a work in
        the form of alpha-numeric notation, musical notation,
        choreographic notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or
        any combination
    -   Manifestation: physical embodiment of an expression of a work.
        In order to record something you have to put it "on or in" some
        container or carrier. So, manifestations appear in various
        "carriers" such as books, periodicals, maps, DVDs, multimedia
        games, Web pages

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Group 1
    -   Item: it is a single object, but sometimes it comprises more
        than one physical object, e.g., a monograph issued in 2
        separately bound volumes or a sound recording on 3 separate CD's
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The entities form a hierarchy with work at the top of the model

:::

## FRBR (Cont.)

-   Group 2 are the entities responsible for the intellectual or
    artistic content, the physical production and dissemination or the
    custodianship of such products: person and corporate body

![](images/frbr3.png){fig-align="center"}

## FRBR (Cont.)

-   Group 3 are the entities that serve as the subjects of intellectual
    or artistic endeavor: concept, object, event, place, and any of the
    Group 1 or Group 2 entities -- you can have a work about another
    work or a work about a person, etc.

## BIBFRAME

-   [Bibliographic Framework](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/) provides a foundation for the future of bibliographic description, both on the web, and in the broader networked world that is grounded in Linked Data techniques

-   BIBFRAME was designed to replace the MARC21 formats while preserving a robust data exchange that has supported resource sharing and cataloging cost savings in recent decades

-   In 2012, LoC announced a new model called MARC Resources (MARCR)
    that developed a linked data alternative to MARC and released a more
    complete draft 

## BIBFRAME (Cont.)
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

of the model later that year, renamed BIBFRAME

-   LoC released version 2.0 of BIBFRAME in 2016

#### Design

- BIBFRAME is expressed in RDF and based on three categories of abstraction (work, instance, item), with three additional classes

(agent, subject, event) that relate to the core categories
![](images/bib.jpg)
:::
:::

## BIBFRAME (Cont.)
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- *Work* entity in BIBFRAME may be considered as the union of the disjoint *work* and *expression* entities of FRBR

- BIBFRAME's instance entity is analogous to the FRBR manifestation entity

- This represents an apparent break with FRBR and the FRBR-based

Resource Description and Access (RDA) cataloging code

- BIBFRAME model argues that it reflect  FRBR relationships in terms of a graph rather than as hierarchical relationships, after applying a reductionist technique

## BIBFRAME (Cont.)
-  Since both FRBR and BIBFRAME have been expressed in RDF, interoperability between the two models is technically possible
