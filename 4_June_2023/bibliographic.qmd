# Bibliographic Description - Introduction {background-color="#438496"}

## INTRODUCTION

-   Unprecedented [growth of literature gives rise to develop adequate
    formats]{style="color: blue;"} with standard bibliographic description [to promote resource
    sharing]{style="color: blue;"} among libraries and to have effective information retrieval
    system

-   The library scenario has been completely [changed with the
    application ICT]{style="color: blue;"} rendered the [traditional manual oriented]{style="color: blue;"}
    bibliographic description standards inadequate paved the way for
    [newer bibliographic standards]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Moreover, the [fast growth of International Bibliographic Exchange
    Formats and lack of compatibility]{style="color: blue;"} poses problems to exchange records
    with one another

-   It is possible if each of the organizations agree upon a [common
    standard format for exchange purpose]{style="color: blue;"} to be..

## INTRODUCTION (Cont.)

..achieved at [National and International level]{style="color: blue;"}

-   In this age of [Information flood and the advent of IT era, it is
    very difficult to locate and retrieve]{style="color: blue;"} the desired information

-   Hence it is necessary that the [efficient information retrieval
    system]{style="color: blue;"} must have a format of [bibliographic description that matches
    its requirements]{style="color: blue;"}

-   A bibliographic format in such a way to be redesigned so as to make
    it most [compatible with the new information environment for
    international library resource sharing]{style="color: blue;"}, [international library loan
    and global networking with the aid of ICT]{style="color: red;"}

## INTRODUCTION (Cont.)

-   The [bibliographic description]{style="color: blue;"} is a [process of recording the items of
    information about the document for easy identification and instant
    location, access and for the purpose of effective dissemination]{style="color: red;"}

-   [IFLA held an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles
    (ICCP) at Paris in 1961]{style="color: blue;"} with a purpose to [achieve international
    standardization in cataloguing]{style="color: red;"}

-   [Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic Description
    (ISBD)]{style="color: blue;"} made it economic & technological necessity for the creation,
    conversion, and use of machine-readable records

-   These rules are standards to [promote universal bibliographic control]{style="color: blue;"}

# Bibliographic Description - Scope, Evolution, Rules {background-color="#438496"}

## SCOPE OF BIBLIO. DES.

::: panel-tabset
## Scope

-   It should focus on proper [functionality of bibliographic records]{style="color: blue;"}
    maintained by libraries & information centers

-   The scope of bibliographic description can be in the [*context of
    coverage, user, application and generic tasks*]{style="color: blue;"} *associated with it*

1.  **Coverage Bibliographic Description** should be comprehensive in
    terms of [variety of materials]{style="color: blue;"} (textual, musical, cartographic,
    audio-visual, graphic, 3-D material, etc.). It must cover [physical
    media]{style="color: blue;"} (film, magnetic storage devices) and [all formats]{style="color: blue;"} (books,

## Scope (Cont.)

sheets discs, cassettes, etc) [all with all modes of recording]{style="color: blue;"} (analogue,
acoustic, digital, etc)

2.  **Users Bibliographic Description** ensure the [use of bibliographic
    records by wide range of users]{style="color: blue;"}. The user groups included [readers,
    students, researchers, library staff, publishers]{style="color: blue;"}, distribution &
    subscription such as [information brokers, retailers, agents]{style="color: blue;"}, etc

3.  **Applications of Bibliographic Description** in relation to
    bibliographic records should support a [wide variety of data &
    bibliographic records]{style="color: blue;"}. It includes [*collection development,
    acquisition, cataloging, production of*]{style="color: red;"}

## Scope (Cont.)

[*finding aids & bibliographies, inventory management, preservation,
circulation, ILL, reference & information retrieval*]{style="color: red;"}

4.  **Tasks Bibliographic Description** should fulfill the [functional
    requirements]{style="color: blue;"} for bibliographic records. It must [allow users' to
    perform all the generic tasks]{style="color: blue;"} at the time of searching and making
    use of bibliographic records. This include [*finding, identifying,
    selecting, & acquiring* material]{style="color: red;"} using bibliographic data

## Scope (Cont.)

-   [Cataloguers]{style="color: blue;"} perform the following [tasks to maintain the catalogues
    or bibliograhic databases]{style="color: blue;"}:

    -   Transcribe
    -   Describe
    -   Make Identifiable
    -   Link
    -   Manage
    -   Convey Rights Management Information
:::

## EVOLUTION

::: panel-tabset
## Intro

-   The [standards, rules and principles of bibliographic description]{style="color: blue;"} are
    also [applicable to online and web environment for discovery]{style="color: red;"},
    [indexing and identification of digital resources by semantic means]{style="color: blue;"}

-   [Metadata schemas for describing electronic resources]{style="color: blue;"} (such as Dublin
    Core, FGDC, GILS, etc.), like traditional bibliographic standards
    and formats, are also designed for information storage and transfer

-   It means that a [bibliographic record]{style="color: blue;"} now performs [different
    functions with respect to various media, various applications, and
    various user needs]{style="color: blue;"}

## Intro (Cont.)

-   This situation calls for a [framework]{style="color: blue;"} that should [identify]{style="color: blue;"} and
    clearly [define bibliographic entities, attributes, relationships and
    tasks performed by users of bibliographic records]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Some [conceptual models]{style="color: blue;"} (such as [IFLA's FRBR model, UKOLN's
    Analytical Model of Collection Description and XOBIS model of
    Stanford University]{style="color: red;"}) have been [developed]{style="color: blue;"} in recent years to
    encompass a broad-spectrum application of bibliographic description
    and use of bibliographic records

## Pre-ISBD

![](images/pre-isbd.png){fig-align="center" width="58%"}

## Pre-ISBD(Cont.)

-   During this period the much-required [agreed-to general format]{style="color: blue;"} for
    bibliographic description [could not be developed]{style="color: blue;"}

-   [IFLA first initiated the development of such a general format in the
    form of ISBD(G) under its Universal Bibliographic Control (UBC)
    program]{style="color: blue;"}
:::

## EVOLUTION

::: panel-tabset
## Ranganathan's Principles

-   Ranganathan [applied scientific method to cataloguing]{style="color: blue;"} & formulated
    [normative principles of cataloguing called Canons of Cataloguing]{style="color: red;"}

-   These principles still serve as the [basis for principles and rules
    of bibliographic description vis-a-vis cataloguing codes]{style="color: blue;"}

-   The general principles for standards for biblio. descrp. are:

1.  **Principle of Context**: It determines the [situational contexts]{style="color: blue;"}
    required for [specifying the elements]{style="color: blue;"} of

## Principles (Cont.)

[bibliographic description and their role]{style="color: blue;"}

2.  **Principle of Permanence**: It says [no element in an entry]{style="color: blue;"}, the
    heading in particular, should be subjected to [change unless rules
    themselves are changed]{style="color: blue;"} in [response]{style="color: blue;"} to the [principle of context]{style="color: blue;"}
3.  **Principle of Consistency**: It says [bibliographic description]{style="color: blue;"} should
    be [consistent for bibliographic records]{style="color: blue;"}
4.  **Principle of Unity of Idea**: It advocates [structural design]{style="color: blue;"} for
    [cataloguing codes]{style="color: red;"} and [standards for bibliographic description]{style="color: red;"}

## RULES

::: panel-tabset
## Intro.

-   [AACR2 adopted standards of ISBD]{style="color: blue;"} for [construction of catalogues]{style="color: red;"} of

# Bibliographic Description - Format {background-color="#438496"}

## Bibliographic Format

::: panel-tabset
## Intro

-   Bibliographic formats have been created for [two purposes]{style="color: blue;"} -- to
    [facilitate search and retrieval of bibliographic records]{style="color: red;"}, [locally
    and in network environment]{style="color: blue;"} and to [exchange bibliographic information]{style="color: red;"}
    among library and information centers

-   A bibliographic format that acts as a means of exchanging data has
    [three basic components]{style="color: blue;"}:

1.  **Physical structure:** [Rules to arrange the data]{style="color: blue;"} to be exchanged on
    a [computer storage medium]{style="color: blue;"} such as CD. etc. [ISO 2709]{style="color: blue;"} is an accepted
    international standard for

## Compo. (Cont.)

exchange of bibliographic data on magnetic tape and other storage media

2.  **Content Designators:** [Tags to define the different data elements]{style="color: blue;"}
    of the records such as [author, date of publication, title]{style="color: blue;"}, so on.
    EG. [MARC family]{style="color: blue;"} (USMARC, CANMARC, UKMARC, UNIMARC, INDIMARC,
    [MARC21]{style="color: blue;"} - combination of USMARC & CANMARC), CCF ([Common Communication
    Format]{style="color: blue;"}), others

3.  **Content:** [Rules & record]{style="color: blue;"} that [helps]{style="color: blue;"} in [formulation of data
    elements for different formats]{style="color: blue;"}. EG. [catalogue codes, ISBD]{style="color: red;"}

## Electronic Resource

-   [ISBD(ER)]{style="color: blue;"} provides a [long list of data elements]{style="color: blue;"} for [describing
    electronic resources & AARC2 guide the cataloguing]{style="color: blue;"} of such resources

-   Some bibliographic formats are UNIMARC, MARC21 developed [special
    field (Field 856) for managing electronic resources]{style="color: blue;"}

-   [Bibliographic formats & cataloguing codes are not enough]{style="color: blue;"} for
    [representing all unique characterstics of digital resources]{style="color: red;"} and
    therefore [metadata standards]{style="color: blue;"} have been [developed as *resource
    description schemas*]{style="color: red;"}
:::

## Bibliographic Format (Cont.)

::: panel-tabset
## Metadata

-   Metadata is [structured information]{style="color: blue;"} that [describes, explains, locates]{style="color: red;"}
    or otherwise makes it [easier to retrieve, use or manage digital
    information resources]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Metadata [schemas are sets of metadata elements designed for a
    particular purpose]{style="color: blue;"}, for example to [describe a particular type of
    information resource]{style="color: red;"}

-   In addition to resource discovery, metadata schemas can help to
    [organise electronic resource]{style="color: blue;"}, [facilitate interoperability]{style="color: red;"} & [resource
    integration]{style="color: blue;"}, [support digital identification]{style="color: red;"} and ensure [archiving and
    preservation]{style="color: blue;"}

## Metadata (Cont.)

-   Many different metadata schemas are being used in library
    environment
    -   **Dublin Core Metadata Schema**: It describes [web based documents]{style="color: blue;"}.
        Dublin Core is a set of [15 main elements]{style="color: blue;"} that fall into [three
        groups -- Contents, Intellectual Property and Instantiation]{style="color: blue;"}.
    -   **Global Information Locator Service (GILS)**: GILS specifies a
        [profile of the Z39.50 protocol]{style="color: blue;"} for search and retrieval. GILS
        records are intended to describe aggregates such as catalogues,
        publishing services and databases.

## Metadata (Cont.)

-   **Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)**: It is a scheme for [marking up
    electronic text]{style="color: blue;"}. It also [specifies a header portion]{style="color: blue;"} to accommodate
    metadata about the object to be described. TEI headers can be used
    to record bibliographic information of [both electronic and
    non-electronic sources]{style="color: blue;"}

-   **Online Information Exchange International (ONIX)**: ONIX is an
    [XML-based]{style="color: blue;"} metadata schema developed for [publishing industry]{style="color: blue;"} to
    response enormous growth in online books sales. It records basic
    [bibliographic data along with trade data and promotional information]{style="color: blue;"}

## BIBFRAME

-   [Bibliographic Framework](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/) provides a
    foundation for the [future of bibliographic description, both on the
    web]{style="color: blue;"}, and in the broader networked world that is grounded in [Linked
    Data techniques]{style="color: blue;"}

-   BIBFRAME was designed to [replace the MARC21 formats]{style="color: blue;"} while [preserving
    a robust data exchange]{style="color: blue;"} that has supported [resource sharing and
    cataloging cost savings]{style="color: blue;"} in recent decades

-   In [2012]{style="color: blue;"}, LoC announced a [new model called MARC Resources (MARCR)]{style="color: blue;"}
    that developed a linked data alternative to MARC and released a more
    complete draft

#### Design

-   BIBFRAME is expressed in [RDF]{style="color: blue;"} and based on [three categories of
