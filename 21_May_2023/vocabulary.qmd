## What Will You Learn - Part A? {background-color="#438496"}

# VOCABULARY & CONTROLLED VOCABULARY {background-color="#438496"}

## WHAT IS VOCABULARY?

-   Vocabulary is a set of terms (words, codes, etc.) that are used in a
    specific community

-   It provides a mechanism for communication (written, oral, or
    electronic) as the meaning of terms are known & agreed upon by the
    community members

-   When a vocabulary is formally *managed*, it becomes **Controlled
    Vocabulary**. Where *managed* means the terms are stored &
    maintained using agreed-upon *procedures*

-   *Procedures* should exist for adding terms, modifying terms, & more
    rarely, deprecating terms from a controlled vocabulary

## DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDEX & VOCABULARY?

|                  | Indexes         | CVs                                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **End product**  | index           | term list                                               |
| **Use**          | content locator | content tagging, website navigation, search enhancement |
| **Project time** | weeks           | months                                                  |
| **Methodology**  | reading         | research                                                |

: Table 1: Indexes and controlled vocabularies compared

## DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDEX & VOCABULARY? (Cont.)

-   Indexes and CVs are intimately connected
-   For example, it is often the case that for large or long-term
    indexing projects, such as journal or newspaper indexes, a CV is
    created first to ensure consistency in indexing by multiple indexers
    over long time spans

## CONTROLLED VOCABULARY (CV)

-   CV is a carefully selected list of words and phrase, which are used
    to tag units of **information** so that they may be more easily
    retrieved by a search

-   The terms are chosen by and organized by trained professionals
    (including Librarians and information scientist) who posses
    expertise in the subject area

-   CV terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually
    about, even if the terms themselves don not occurs within the text

-   Fully developed CV systems are LCSH, Sears List, Thesaurus etc.

## CONTROLLED VOCABULARY (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In other words, CV is a collection of terms that are:

    -   **Accepted**: Terms must adhere to community practices
    -   **Defined**: Terms are precisely characterized. Typically, this
        means the terms have rigorous definitions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Managed**: In general, there will be a body of experts that create
    and maintain the CV. The maintenance of CV will involve periodic
    review, addition of new terms, modification of terms, and
    occasionally deprecation of terms
:::
:::

## CONTROLLED VOCABULARY (Cont.)

-   For example in the LCSH (a subject heading system that uses a
    controlled vocabulary), **authorized terms**- **subject heading in
    this case** - have to be chosen to handle choice between variant
    spelling of the same words, choice among the scientific and popular
    terms and choice between synonyms among other different issues

# CV: PURPOSE, CHARACTERSTICS, CATEGORIES, & TYPES {background-color="#438496"}

## PURPOSE OF CV

#### CV can serve several different purposes:

-   It can help users to find data (also known as a **discovery
    vocabulary**)

-   It can assist in the interpretation of data (also known as **usage
    vocabulary**)

-   It can provide human-understandable meaning (also known as
    **semantic vocabulary**)

-   It can produce machine-readable format information (also known as
    **syntactic vocabulary**)

## PURPOSE OF CV (Cont.)

#### CV provide these abilities by:

-   Establishing the permissible terms to be used
-   Maintaining the proper and agreed-upon spelling of the terms
-   Clarifying terms for those who are new to the community
-   Eliminating the use of arbitrary terms that can cause
    inconsistencies and confusion

From the above we can say that CV ensure consistencies in indexing,
tagging or categorizing and to guide the user where the desire
information is

## WITH AND WITHOUT CV

![Fig. 1: With & Without CV](images/with-without.png){fig-align="center"
width="1300"}

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV

-   Most important characteristics of CV is **relationship**

-   Terms in CV are related in certain ways:

1.  **Equivalence Relationship**

-   It is the most basic term [relationship in
    synonyms]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It is important to note that [context]{style="color: blue;"} is
    important in determining synonyms

-   Example, if you use "automobiles" on your homepage & "cars" on next
    page, users might get confused. Users might start to wonder if there
    is a difference between the two terms. Instead you choose
    "automobiles" & don't use "cars".

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   So, using "automobiles" as ["preferred term"]{style="color: blue;"}
    & "cars" as variant term that is representing the same concept

-   There are many examples where alternate terms are used:

a)  [Synonyms]{style="color: blue;"} (two words with the same meaning,
    like "jeans" and "dungarees")
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
b)  [Homonyms]{style="color: blue;"} (words that sound the same, but
    have different meanings, like "bank" the financial institution and
    "bank" the side of a stream or river)
c)  [Common misspellings]{style="color: blue;"}
d)  [Changes in content]{style="color: blue;"} (e.g., countries that
    change their name or have multiple spellings)
:::
:::

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
e)  [Identifying "Best Bets"]{style="color: blue;"} or the most popular
    pages associated with a certain term
f)  Connecting a woman's married name to her maiden name
g)  [Connecting abbreviations]{style="color: blue;"} to the full word
    (e.g., NY and New York, the chemical symbol Si with the element
    Silicon)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Types of Equivalence Relationship:

-   There are 2 types of synonym equivalence lists - [Synonym
    rings]{style="color: blue;"}: They are used in searching behind the
    scenes as a way to connect various terms of a concept. EG. When
    someone searches for "Si", give them all documents with both "Si" &
    "Silicon"
:::
:::

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

#### Types of Equivalence Relationship (Cont.)

-   [Authority files]{style="color: blue;"}: When you need to display
    one of these terms in your navigation and pick one to be a preferred
    term, then you have an authority file

2.  **Hierarchical Relationship**

-   Terms display hierarchical relationship when one term is broader in
    meaning than its child terms (which has a narrower meaning)

-   Pairs of the terms are represented in their [super
    ordinate]{style="color: blue;"} & [subordinate
    status]{style="color: blue;"}

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

-   [Super ordinate term (BT)]{style="color: blue;"} representing the
    whole while the [subordinate term (NT)]{style="color: blue;"}
    representing a member or a part

-   EG. **LIBRARY USERS**

    -   **BT** Persons
    -   **NT** Internet access for library users
        -   Library catalogs and users

-   It can help you formulate your homepage navigation. It could improve
    your searching and browsing. It can help users broaden and narrow
    their search results quickly by showing them where each set of
    results fits into the site's hierarchy

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

4.  **Associative Relationship**

-   It denotes the relationship between the term that is neither
    hierarchical nor equivalence

-   Yet the terms are mentally associated to such an extent that link
    between them should be made explicit in CV and revel alternative
    terms that could be used in indexing or retrieval

-   It is very difficult to define the relationship between the term and
    therefore to determine between a pairs of terms, some guidelines are
    follow:

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

#### The Associative terms are divided into two categories:

i)  [Terms belonging to the same category]{style="color: blue;"}. For
    example *Sibling* with overlapping meaning, such as 'Ship' and
    'boats'
ii) [Terms belong to different categories]{style="color: blue;"}. The
    term should be implied when other is used in indexing. For example,
    an action or product and product of the action. Such as Programming
    \<-\> Software

## CV CATEGORY & TYPES

> `To many people, the English language is a well-known vocabulary. We have many ways of representing the terms in the English language. For example, if we want to figure out what a specific word means we might consult a glossary; if we want to know the origin of a term we might consult a dictionary; and if we want to know how the term relates to other terms we might consult a thesaurus. We also need to recognize that the meaning of terms may change through time. Generations use terms in different ways (cool in one generation means a low temperature, while cool in another is a positive adjective).`

## CV CATEGORY & TYPES (Cont.)

-   To enable formal management, a controlled vocabulary can be
    organized in several ways. There are three broad categories of
    controlled vocabularies:

![](images/cv%20types.png){fig-align="center"}

# CV : CLASSIFICATION {background-color="#438496"}

## CV CLASSIFICATION BY FUNCTIONALITY

![](images/functionality.png){fig-align="\"center"}\

# FLAT CONTROLLED VOCABULARY {background-color="#438496"}

## FLAT CV TYPES

1.  **Authority Files**

-   These are the lists of terms that are used to control the variant
    names for an entity or the domain value for a particular field

-   EG. names for *countries, individuals, organizations*

> Sometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for
> only one person or subject. This can bring confusion since researchers
> may miss some information. Authority control is used by cataloguers to
> collocate materials that logically belong together but which present
> themselves differently.

## FLAT CV TYPES (Cont.)

> Records are used to establish uniform titles which collocate all
> versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such
> versions are issued under different titles, such as different
> spelling, pen names etc. The unique header can guide users to all
> relevant information including related or collocated subjects.
> Authority records can be combined into a database and called an
> authority file and maintaining and updating these files as well as
> "logical linkages" to other files within them is the work of
> librarians and other information cataloguers.

## FLAT CV TYPES (Cont.)

2.  **Glossaries**

-   A glossary is a list of terms, usually with definitions

-   Terms may be from a specific subject field or from a particular work

-   Terms are defined within a specific environment and rarely include
    variant meanings

-   EG. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Terms of the Environment,
    Glossary of Library and Information Science

## FLAT CV TYPES (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
3.  **Dictionaries**

-   Dictionaries are alphabetical lists of words and their definitions

-   Variant senses are provided where applicable

-   Dictionaries are more general in scope than are glossaries

-   They may also provide information about the origin of a word,
    variants
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
(by spelling and morphology), and multiple meanings across disciplines -
While a dictionary may also provide synonyms and through the
definitions, related words, there is no explicit hierarchical structure
or attempt to group them by concept

-   EG. Oxford English Dictionary, Subject Dictionary
:::
:::

## FLAT CV TYPES (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
4.  **Gazetters**

-   A gazetter is a list of place names

-   Traditional gazetters have been published as books or have appeared
    as indexes to atlases

-   Each entry may also be identified by feature type, such as river,
    city, or school

-   Geospatially referenced
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
gazatteers provide coordinates for locating the place on the earth's
surface

-   The term gazetteer has several other meanings, including
    announcement publication such as a patent or legal gazetteer

-   These gazetters are often organized using classification schemes or
    subject categories

-   EG U.S. Code of Geographic Names

5.  **Code List**

-   It is consists of a set of codes & meanings used in a specific
    project

::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  **Subject Headings**

-   This scheme type provides a set of controlled terms to represent the
    subjects of items in a collection

-   The main objective of subject cataloguing is to fulfill the subject
    related needs of the readers

-   Subject Heading scheme helps the cataloguer/indexer to
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
summarizing the thought content of the document in to a no. of accepted
term

-   Subject Heading schemes are:

    -   Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
    -   Library of Congress Headings (LCSH)
    -   SEARS List of Subject Headings
:::
:::

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH)

-   MeSH is the controlled vocabulary thesaurus that gives uniformity
    and consistency to the indexing and cataloging of biomedical
    literature. It connects all the different ways to express a concept,
    such as "cancer."

-   MeSH are standardized vocabulary of app. 20,000 terms that describe
    the biomedical concepts covered in the MEDLINE/PubMed database.
    MEDLINE is directly searchable from PubMed

-   MeSH consists of a set of terms or subject headings that are
    arranged in both an alphabetic and a hierarchical structure

-   MeSH thesaurus is produced by the National Library of Medicine (NLM)

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH) (Cont.)

-   When each article is indexed, an indexer at NLM assigns from 5 to 20
    headings describing the concepts covered in the article

-   MeSH headings are powerful searching tools

-   They locate documents by assigned controlled vocabulary, not free
    text words, and are independent of the occurrence of specific words
    in any other field

-   MeSH headings allow you to retrieve all references to a particular
    topic, even if different terminology was used in the records

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH) (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   MeSH vocabulary includes several important features. The four most
    important are:

i)  **Main Headings (MeSH headings/preferred terms/descriptors)**

-   They represent concepts found in the biomedical literature
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   These records are topical headings that are used to index citations
    in MEDLINE, for cataloging of publications, and for use in other
    databases

-   Most main headings indicate the subject of an indexed item

-   For a journal article, main headings describe what the article is
    about
:::
:::

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH) (Cont.)

-   Main headings are generally added or revised in MeSH vocabulary on
    an annual basis

![](images/MainHeadings.png){fig-align="center"}

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH) (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
ii) **Subheadings (qualifiers)**

-   They are associated with MeSH main headings to pinpoint the specific
    aspect of the concept represented by the subject heading

-   They are a way of grouping together those citations that are
    concerned with a particular characteristics
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
of a subject

-   EG Liver may be qualified with subheading drug-effects
    ("Liver-drug-effects")

:::
:::

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH) (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
iii) **Check Tags**

-   These are special use descriptors that do not represent subject
    matter per se but that reflect parameters or aspects of subject
    concept

-   Special efforts in indexing assures that these will be included or
    "checked" each time they appear as
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
aspects in an item being indexed

-   Following list of descriptors must be entered by an indexer for very
    journal article citation to which they apply

    -   ANIMAL - HUMANS\
    -   FEMALE - MALE\
:::

iv) **Publication Characteristics (types)**

-   They describe the type of publication being indexed (i.e. format of
    the publication) or characteristics of the research (i.e. research
    design)

-   They are also Publication Type term that describe
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
what type of organization funded the research

-   They are of 3 main categories:

    -   Publication Components (eg. Abstracts)
    -   Publication Formats (eg. Lectures, Letter)
    -   Study Characteristics (eg. Clinical Trial, Twin Study)

v)  **Age Group Headings**

-   There is a collection of age group heading in MeSH which are
    assigned whenever someone in that age group is noted in a paper
-   All age groups listed in the paper are indexed. Age groups are
    rarely assigned to major MeSH field

## LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADING (LCSH)

-   LCSH came in to existence in the year 1898 by the Library of
    Congress (LoC), USA and is also maintained by the same

-   LCSH system was originally designed as a controlled vocabulary for
    representing the subject and form of the books and serials in the
    LoC collection

-   Now it is widely accepted by Libraries & Information Center around
    the world

-   LCSH is also known as "Big Red Books"

-   It consists of 5 volumes and published annually

## LCSH (Cont.)

-   Subject authority records are available online

-   The last print edition was published in 2016. Access to the
    continuously revised vocabulary is now available via subscription
    and [free
    services](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCSH/freelcsh.html)

-   At present running edition is 44th (2022)

-   There were 382,713 authority records in the file as of March 2022

-   The creation and revision of subject headings is a continuous
    process. Approximately 4,000 new headings, including headings with
    subdivisions, are added to LCSH each year

## LCSH (Cont.)

#### Principles of Heading Construction

1.  [Fundamental principles of LCSH]{style="color: blue;"}
2.  [Structure of subject headings]{style="color: blue;"}
3.  [Generation of headings & cross references]{style="color: blue;"}
4.  [Main headings]{style="color: blue;"}
5.  [Subdivisions]{style="color: blue;"}
6.  [Pre-coordination & synthesis]{style="color: blue;"}
7.  [Term relationships]{style="color: blue;"}

9.  [Class numbers]{style="color: blue;"}

## LCSH (Cont.)

1.  [**Fundamental principles of LCSH**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   The fundamental principle guiding the development of LoC subject
    headings system are effective responses to

    -   User needs
    -   Uniform heading (one heading per subject - control of synonyms)
    -   Unique heading (one subject per heading control of homographs)
    -   Specific & direct entry
    -   Stability
    -   Consistency

2.  [**Structure of Subject Headings**]{style="color: blue;"}

*A. Single Concept Headings*

-   Automobiles
-   Botany
-   Budget deficits
-   Electric
-   Interference

3.  [**Main Headings**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It is that part of the subject heading string which represents the
    main concept without subdivision

-   Main headings may be categorized according to their functions
    (topical headings, form headings, & different kinds of proper name
    headings)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Types & Functions of Main Headings

A. *Topical Headings*

-   It represents a concept or object treated in in a bibliographic
    item. It reflects what the item is about. Eg. Economy, German
    language, Soldiers as artists
:::
:::

## LCSH (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
B. *Form Headings*

-   A form heading reflects the form of the material

-   There are various forms of reading material in the library. Eg. (a)
    Bibliographic Form (b) Artistic and Literary form
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Syntax

**Topical and form headings**

-   All main headings consist of single nouns or noun equivalents. Noun
    equivalents may be in the form of adjectives or gerunds or in the
    form of adjectival phrases, conjunctive phrases, or prepositional
    phrases

-   Qualifiers are added to headings when necessary
:::
:::

## LCSH (Cont.)

A. *Single Noun Headings*

-   Many topical and form headings consist of a single noun or a noun
    equivalent in the form of a single adjective or gerund

-   Nouns representing concrete objects are normally in the plural form,
    and nouns representing abstract concepts appear in the singular.
    Examples Enzymes, Running, Art, Education, Religion, Philosophies,
    Deaf, Agriculture

## LCSH (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
B. *Phrase Headings*

-   Some concepts that involve two areas of knowledge can be expressed
    only by more or less complex phrases. Example Bible as literature,
    Freedom of information

-   There are various types of Phrase Headings which are as follows:
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
1)  *Adjectival headings:* Computer architecture, Social classes
2)  *Conjunctive phrase headings:* Children and politics, Boats and
    boating
3)  *Prepositional phrase headings:* Directors of Corporations, Doctor
    of philosophy degree
4)  *Inverted phrase headings:* Children's literature - Canadian,
    Education - Higher, Taxation - Exemption from
:::

## LCSH (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
4.  [**Subdivisions**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Subdivisions are extensions of the main heading. They normally
    represent aspects of the main heading

i)  *Topical subdivisions:* Intellectual life, Marketing, Religious
    aspects
ii) *Form subdivisions:* Bibliography, Periodicals, Poetry, Tables
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
iii) *Geographic subdivisions:* Geographic subdivision again divided in
     to two parts namely

<!-- -->

a.  *Direct Subdivision:* Music-Japan, Music-California
b.  *Indirect Subdivision:* Music-France-Paris, Music-Ontario-Toronto
:::
:::

## LCSH (Cont.)

iv) *Chronological subdivisions*

-   Art, Modern-20th century
-   India-History-1800-1899 (19th century)
-   France-History-Revolution, 1797-1802
-   Lebanon-History-1982-1984
-   Poland-Economic conditions-1945-
-   United States-History-1945-1953
-   Bermuda Islands-Description andtravel-1979-

## LCSH (Cont.)

5.  [**Pre-coordination and synthesis**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   A heading may contain a single concept or a combination of multiple
    concepts

-   The combination may be formed when the heading is being established
    or when it is assigned to a particular bibliographic item

A. *Multiple-concept main headings:* Children and politics, Electricity
in art, Religious education of teenage boys

B. *Headings with Subdivisions:* Birth control-Moral and ethical
aspects, Cinematography-Electronic equipment, Philosophy and
Ancient-Oriental

## LCSH (Cont.)

6.  [**Term Relationship**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   There are four types of term relationships in LCSH

A. Equivalence relationships

-   USE references are made from unauthorized or non preferred terms to
    an authorized or preferred heading

-   UF (Used For) precedes the term not used

-   The codes USE and UF function as reciprocals

![](images/equi.png){fig-align="center"}

## LCSH (Cont.)

B. Hierarchical relationships

![](images/bt-nt.png){fig-align="center"}

## LCSH (Cont.)

C. Associative relationships
![](images/associative.png){fig-align="center"}

## LCSH (Cont.)

D. General and Specific references

-   A general reference is a reference made not to specific individual
    headings but to an entire group of headings, frequently listing one
    or more headings by way of example

-   It is denoted by *see also (SA)*

-   Example:

    -   Chemistry

        -   SA headings beginning with the word Chemical

## LCSH (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
7.  [**Subject Heading for Special Materials in
    LCSH**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   The assignment of subject heading for audiovisual and special
    instructional materials should follow the same principles that are
    applied to books

-   The heading most specifically describing the contents of the
    material should be used
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   And the same headings should be applied to book and non book
    material alike

-   Example:

    -   American poetry-Periodicals

    -   Tuberculosis-Statistics-Periodicals

    -   Jesus Christ-Travel-Palestine-Maps-To 1800

    -   Accounting-Periodical

-   A Library of Congress Classification number is added to a heading if
    the caption for the number is identical or nearly identical in
    scope, meaning, and language to the subject heading, or if the topic
    is explicitly mentioned in an "Including" note under the caption for
    the number

-   Multiple class numbers may be added to a heading when the subject is
    treated from more than one perspective

-   For the heading of a subject covered by a span of class numbers, the
    full span of pertinent class numbers is included

#### Principles of the SEARS list   

- It is based on the
principles of the LoC Subject
headings

- The principles are:

1. [**Specific entry**]{style="color: blue;"}

- It means that subject
should be entered under its most specific
heading, not under the class to which it
belongs

- For example,
- Rose should be entered under "Rose"/"Lotus" not under "flowers"
- Penguin is entered "Penguins" not under
Birds or even not under water Birds
