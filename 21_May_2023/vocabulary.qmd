# VOCABULARY & CONTROLLED VOCABULARY {background-color="#438496"}

## WHAT IS VOCABULARY?

-   Vocabulary is a [set of terms]{style="color: blue;"} (words, codes, etc.) that are used in a
    specific community

-   It provides a mechanism for communication (written, oral, or
    electronic) as the meaning of terms are known & agreed upon by the
    community members

-   When a vocabulary is [formally *managed*]{style="color: blue;"}, it becomes **Controlled Vocabulary**. Where *managed* means the terms are stored &
    maintained using agreed-upon *procedures*

-   *Procedures* should exist for adding terms, modifying terms, & more
    rarely, deprecating terms from a controlled vocabulary

## DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDEX & VOCABULARY?

|                  | Indexes         | CVs                                                     |

| **Use**          | content locator | content tagging, website navigation, search enhancement |
| **Project time** | weeks           | months                                                  |
| **Methodology**  | reading         | research                                                |

## CONTROLLED VOCABULARY (CV)

-   CV is a [carefully selected list of words and phrase]{style="color: blue;"}, which are used
    to tag units of information so that they may be more easily
    retrieved by a search

-   The terms are [chosen by]{style="color: blue;"} and organized by trained professionals
    (including Librarians and information scientist) who posses
    expertise in the subject area

-   CV terms can [accurately describe what a given document is actually about]{style="color: blue;"}, even if the terms themselves do not occurs within the text

-   Fully developed CV systems are [LCSH, Sears List, Thesaurus]{style="color: blue;"} etc.

## CONTROLLED VOCABULARY (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In other words, CV is a collection of terms that are:

    -   **Accepted**: Terms must [adhere to community practices]{style="color: blue;"}
    -   **Defined**: Terms are [precisely characterized]{style="color: blue;"}. Typically, this
        means the terms have rigorous definitions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Managed**: In general, there will be a body of [experts that create
    and maintain the CV]{style="color: blue;"}. The maintenance of CV will involve periodic
    [review, addition of new terms, modification of terms]{style="color: blue;"}, and
    occasionally deprecation of terms

# CV: PURPOSE, CHARACTERSTICS, CATEGORIES, & TYPES {background-color="#438496"}

## PURPOSE OF CV

#### [CV can serve several different purposes:]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It can help users to [find data]{style="color: blue;"} (also known as a **discovery
    vocabulary**)

-   It can assist in the [interpretation of data]{style="color: blue;"} (also known as **usage
    vocabulary**)

-   It can provide [human-understandable]{style="color: blue;"} meaning (also known as
    **semantic vocabulary**)

-   It can produce [machine-readable format]{style="color: blue;"} information (also known as
    **syntactic vocabulary**)

## PURPOSE OF CV (Cont.)

#### [CV provide these abilities by:]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Establishing the [permissible terms]{style="color: blue;"} to be used
-   Maintaining the [proper and agreed-upon spelling]{style="color: blue;"} of the terms
-   [Clarifying terms]{style="color: blue;"} for those who are new to the community
-   [Eliminating]{style="color: blue;"} the use of arbitrary terms that can cause
    [inconsistencies and confusion]{style="color: blue;"}

From the above we can say that [CV ensure consistencies in indexing,
tagging or categorizing and to guide the user where the desire
information is]{style="color: blue;"}

## WITH AND WITHOUT CV

![Fig. 1: With & Without CV](images/with-without.png){fig-align="center"
width="1300"}

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV

-   Most important characteristics of CV is **relationship**

-   Terms in CV are related in certain ways:

1.  **Equivalence Relationship**

-   It is the most basic term [relationship in
    synonyms]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It is important to note that [context]{style="color: blue;"} is
    important in determining synonyms

-   Example, if you use "automobiles" on your homepage & "cars" on next
    page, users might get confused. Users might start to wonder if there
    is a difference between the two terms. Instead you choose
    "automobiles" & don't use "cars".

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   So, using "automobiles" as ["preferred term"]{style="color: blue;"}
    & "cars" as variant term that is representing the same concept

-   There are many [examples where alternate terms are used]{style="color: blue;"}:

a)  [Synonyms]{style="color: blue;"} (two words with the same meaning,
    like "jeans" and "dungarees")
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
b)  [Homonyms]{style="color: blue;"} (words that sound the same, but
    have different meanings, like "bank" the financial institution and
    "bank" the side of a stream or river)
c)  [Common misspellings]{style="color: blue;"}
d)  [Changes in content]{style="color: blue;"} (e.g., countries that
    change their name or have multiple spellings)
:::
:::

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
e)  [Identifying "Best Bets"]{style="color: blue;"} or the most popular
    pages associated with a certain term
f)  Connecting a woman's married name to her maiden name
g)  [Connecting abbreviations]{style="color: blue;"} to the full word
    (e.g., NY and New York, the chemical symbol Si with the element
    Silicon)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### [Types of Equivalence Relationship:]{style="color: blue;"}

-   There are 2 types of synonym equivalence lists - **Synonym rings**: They are used in [searching behind the
    scenes as a way to connect various terms of a concept]{style="color: blue;"}. EG. When
    someone searches for "Si", give them all documents with both "Si" &
    "Silicon"
:::
:::

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

#### [Types of Equivalence Relationship (Cont.)]{style="color: blue;"}

- **Authority files**: When you need to [display
    one of the terms in your navigation and pick one to be a preferred
    term]{style="color: blue;"}, then you have an authority file

2.  **Hierarchical Relationship**

-   Terms display hierarchical relationship when one term is broader in
    meaning than its child terms (which has a narrower meaning)

-   Pairs of the terms are represented in their [super
    ordinate]{style="color: blue;"} & [subordinate
    status]{style="color: blue;"}

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

-   [Super ordinate term (BT)]{style="color: blue;"} representing the
    whole while the [subordinate term (NT)]{style="color: blue;"}
    representing a member or a part

-   EG. **LIBRARY USERS**

    -   **BT** Persons
    -   **NT** Internet access for library users
        -   Library catalogs and users

-   It can help you formulate your [homepage navigation]{style="color: blue;"}. It could [improve
    your searching and browsing]{style="color: blue;"}. It can help users [broaden and narrow
    their search results quickly]{style="color: blue;"} by showing them where each set of
    results fits into the site's hierarchy

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

4.  **Associative Relationship**

-   It denotes the [relationship between the term]{style="color: blue;"} that is neither
    hierarchical nor equivalence

-   Yet the terms are mentally associated to such an extent that link
    between them should be made explicit in CV and revel alternative
    terms that could be used in indexing or retrieval

-   It is very [difficult to define the relationship]{style="color: blue;"} between the term and
    therefore to determine between a pairs of terms, [some guidelines]{style="color: blue;"} are
    follow:

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CV (Cont.)

#### [The Associative terms are divided into two categories:]{style="color: blue;"}

i)  [Terms belonging to the same category]{style="color: blue;"}. For
    example *Sibling* with overlapping meaning, such as 'Ship' and
    'boats'
ii) [Terms belong to different categories]{style="color: blue;"}. The
    term should be implied when other is used in indexing. For example,
    an action or product and product of the action. Such as Programming
    \<-\> Software


## CV CATEGORY & TYPES (Cont.)

-   To enable formal management, a controlled vocabulary can be
    organized in several ways. There are three broad categories of
    controlled vocabularies:

![](images/cv%20types.png){fig-align="center"}

# CV : CLASSIFICATION {background-color="#438496"}

## CV CLASSIFICATION BY FUNCTIONALITY

![](images/functionality.png){fig-align="\"center"}\

# FLAT CONTROLLED VOCABULARY {background-color="#438496"}

## FLAT CV TYPES

1.  **Authority Files**

-   These are the lists of terms that are used to [control the variant
    names]{style="color: blue;"} for an entity or the domain value for a particular field

-   EG. names for *countries, individuals, organizations*

> Sometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for
> only one person or subject. This can bring confusion since researchers
> may miss some information. Authority control is used by cataloguers to
> collocate materials that logically belong together but which present
> themselves differently.

## FLAT CV TYPES (Cont.)

> Records are used to establish uniform titles which collocate all
> versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such
> versions are issued under different titles, such as different
> spelling, pen names etc. The unique header can guide users to all
> relevant information including related or collocated subjects.
> Authority records can be combined into a database and called an
> authority file and maintaining and updating these files as well as
> "logical linkages" to other files within them is the work of
> librarians and other information cataloguers.

2.  **Glossaries**

-   A glossary is a list of terms, usually with [definitions]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Terms may be from a [specific subject field]{style="color: blue;"} or from a particular work

-   Terms are defined within a [specific environment and rarely include
    variant meanings]{style="color: blue;"} 

-   EG. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Terms of the Environment,
    Glossary of Library and Information Science

## FLAT CV TYPES (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
3.  **Dictionaries**

-   Dictionaries are [alphabetical lists of words and their definitions]{style="color: blue;"} 

-   [Variant]{style="color: blue;"}  senses are provided where applicable

-   Dictionaries are more [general in scope]{style="color: blue;"}  than are glossaries

-   They may also provide information about the [origin of a word,
    variants]{style="color: blue;"} 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
(by spelling and morphology), and [multiple meanings across disciplines]{style="color: blue;"}  -
While a dictionary may also provide [synonyms]{style="color: blue;"}  and through the
definitions, related words, there is [no explicit hierarchical structure
or attempt to group them by concept]{style="color: blue;"} 

-   EG. Oxford English Dictionary, Subject Dictionary
:::
:::

## FLAT CV TYPES (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
4.  **Gazetters**

-   A gazetter is a [list of place names]{style="color: blue;"} 

-   Traditional gazetters have been published as books or have appeared
    as indexes to atlases

-   [Each entry may also be identified by feature type]{style="color: blue;"}, such as river,
    city, or school

-   Geospatially referenced
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
gazatteers provide [coordinates]{style="color: blue;"}  for locating the place on the earth's
surface

-   The term gazetteer has several other meanings, including
    announcement publication such as a patent or legal gazetteer

-   These gazetters are often [organized using classification schemes or
    subject categories]{style="color: blue;"} 

-   EG U.S. Code of Geographic Names

1.  **Subject Headings**

-   This scheme type provides [a set of controlled terms to represent the
    subjects]{style="color: blue;"} of items in a collection

-   The main objective of subject cataloguing is to fulfill the subject
    related needs of the readers

-   Subject Heading scheme helps the cataloguer/indexer to
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[summarizing the thought content]{style="color: blue;"}  of the document in to a no. of accepted
term

-   Subject Heading schemes are:

    -   [**Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)**]{style="color: blue;"} 
    -   [**Library of Congress Headings (LCSH)**]{style="color: blue;"} 
    -   [**SEARS List of Subject Headings**]{style="color: blue;"} 
:::
:::

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH)

-   MeSH is the controlled vocabulary [thesaurus that gives uniformity
    and consistency to the indexing and cataloging of biomedical
    literature]{style="color: blue;"} . It [connects all the different ways to express a concept]{style="color: red;"} ,
    such as "cancer."

-   MeSH are standardized vocabulary of app. 20,000 terms that describe
    the biomedical concepts covered in the MEDLINE/PubMed database.
    MEDLINE is directly searchable from PubMed

-   MeSH consists of a set of terms or subject headings that are
    arranged in both an [alphabetic and a hierarchical structure]{style="color: blue;"} 

-   MeSH thesaurus is produced by the National Library of Medicine (NLM)

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH) (Cont.)

-   When each article is indexed, an indexer at NLM assigns from 5 to 20
    headings describing the concepts covered in the article

-   MeSH headings are powerful searching tools

-   They locate documents by assigned controlled vocabulary, not free
    text words, and are independent of the occurrence of specific words
    in any other field

-   MeSH headings allow you to retrieve all references to a particular
    topic, even if different terminology was used in the records

## MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING (MeSH) (Cont.)
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   MeSH vocabulary includes several [important features]{style="color: blue;"}. The four most
    important are:

i)  **Main Headings (MeSH headings/preferred terms/descriptors)**


-   They represent [concepts]{style="color: blue;"} found in the biomedical literature


:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Main headings are generally added or revised in MeSH vocabulary on
    an annual basis

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
ii) **Subheadings (qualifiers)**

-   They are [associated with MeSH main headings]{style="color: blue;"} to pinpoint the specific
    aspect of the concept represented by the subject heading

-   They are a way of [grouping together those citations]{style="color: blue;"} that are
    concerned with a particular [characteristics]{style="color: blue;"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
of a subject

-   EG Liver may be qualified with subheading drug-effects

iii) **Check Tags**

-   These are [special use descriptors]{style="color: blue;"} that do not represent subject
    matter per se but that [reflect parameters or aspects]{style="color: blue;"} of subject
    concept

-   Special efforts in indexing assures that these will be included or
    "checked" each time they appear as
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
aspects in an item being indexed

-   Following list of descriptors must be entered by an indexer for very
    journal article citation to which they apply

    -   ANIMAL - HUMANS\
    -   FEMALE - MALE\

iv) **Publication Characteristics (types)**

-   They describe the [type of publication]{style="color: blue;"} being indexed (i.e. [format]{style="color: blue;"} of
    the publication) or characteristics of the research (i.e. [research
    design]{style="color: blue;"})

-   They are also Publication Type term that describe
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
what type of [organization funded]{style="color: blue;"} the research

-   They are of 3 main categories:

    -   [Publication Components]{style="color: blue;"} (eg. Abstracts)
    -   [Publication Formats]{style="color: blue;"} (eg. Lectures, Letter)
    -   [Study Characteristics]{style="color: blue;"} (eg. Clinical Trial, Twin Study)

## LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADING (LCSH)

-   LCSH came in to existence in the year 1898 by the Library of
    Congress (LoC), USA and is also maintained by the same

-   LCSH system was originally designed as a controlled vocabulary for
    representing the subject and form of the books and serials in the
    LoC collection

-   Now it is widely accepted by Libraries & Information Center around
    the world

-   LCSH is also known as "Big Red Books"

-   It consists of 5 volumes and published annually

## LCSH (Cont.)

-   Subject authority records are available online

-   The last print edition was published in 2016. Access to the
    continuously revised vocabulary is now available via subscription
    and [free
    services](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCSH/freelcsh.html)

-   At present running edition is 44th (2022)

-   There were 382,713 authority records in the file as of March 2022

-   The creation and revision of subject headings is a continuous
    process. Approximately 4,000 new headings, including headings with
    subdivisions, are added to LCSH each year

    main concept without subdivision]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Main headings may be [categorized according to their functions]{style="color: blue;"}
    (topical headings, form headings, & different kinds of proper name
    headings)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### [Types & Functions of Main Headings]{style="color: blue;"}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### [Syntax]{style="color: blue;"}

[**Topical and form headings**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   All [main headings consist of single nouns or noun equivalents]{style="color: blue;"}. Noun
    equivalents may be in the form of adjectives or gerunds or in the
    form of adjectival phrases, conjunctive phrases, or prepositional
    phrases

-   [Qualifiers are added to headings when necessary]{style="color: blue;"}
:::
:::

## LCSH (Cont.)

[A. *Single Noun Headings*]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Many topical and form headings consist of a [single noun or a noun
    equivalent]{style="color: blue;"} in the form of a single adjective or gerund

-   Nouns representing [concrete objects are normally in the plural form]{style="color: blue;"},
    and nouns representing [abstract concepts appear in the singular]{style="color: blue;"}.

5.  [**Pre-coordination and synthesis**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   A heading may contain a [single concept or a combination of multiple
    concepts]{style="color: blue;"}

-   The combination may be formed when the heading is being established
    or when it is assigned to a particular bibliographic item

[A. *Multiple-concept main headings:*]{style="color: blue;"} Children and politics, Electricity
in art, Religious education of teenage boys

[B. *Headings with Subdivisions:*]{style="color: blue;"} Birth control-Moral and ethical
aspects, Cinematography-Electronic equipment, Philosophy and
Ancient-Oriental

## LCSH (Cont.)

6.  [**Term Relationship**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   There are four types of term relationships in LCSH

[A. Equivalence relationships]{style="color: blue;"}

-   USE references are made from unauthorized or non preferred terms to
    an authorized or preferred heading

-   UF (Used For) precedes the term not used

-   The codes USE and UF function as reciprocals

[D. General and Specific references]{style="color: blue;"}

-   A general reference is a reference made not to specific individual
    headings but to an [entire group of headings]{style="color: blue;"}, frequently listing one
    or more headings by way of example

-   It is denoted by [*see also (SA)*]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Example:

    -   Chemistry

        -   SA headings beginning with the word Chemical

7.  [**Subject Heading for Special Materials in
    LCSH**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   The assignment of subject heading for [audiovisual and special
    instructional materials]{style="color: blue;"} should follow the [same principles]{style="color: blue;"} that are
    applied to books

-   The heading most specifically describing the contents of the
    material should be used
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Example:

    -   American poetry-Periodicals

    -   Tuberculosis-Statistics-Periodicals

    -   Jesus Christ-Travel-Palestine-Maps-To 1800

9.  [**Class Numbers**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   A Library of Congress [Classification number is added to a heading]{style="color: blue;"} if
    the caption for the number is identical or nearly identical in
    scope, meaning, and language to the subject heading, or if the topic
    is explicitly mentioned in an "Including" note under the caption for
    the number

-   [Multiple class numbers]{style="color: blue;"} may be added to a heading when the subject is
    treated from more than one perspective

-   For the heading of a subject covered by a span of class numbers, the
    full span of pertinent class numbers is included

#### [DISADVANTAGES]{style="color: red;"}

-   It is American biased

-   The words that are used in it are the [words that are popular in
    American dialect]{style="color: blue;"} and which are not popular to Indian conditions

-   Many [discrepancies]{style="color: blue;"} regarding the subject headings can also be seen
    in it like

    -   Labor-Labour

    -   Color-Colour

    -   Elevators-Lifts

## SEARS LIST OF SUBJECT HEADING

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The Sears List of Subject Headings (popularly called the Sears List)
    is a known tool for assigning standardized subject headings to all
    types of documents in a general small libraries having up to 20,000
    titles in all subjects

-   Sears List of Subject Headings was first designed in 1923 by Minnie
    Earl Sears (1873-1933)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
and has been continuing with her name
![](images/sears.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

-   It was designed with the objective of small libraries for simple and
    broader subject headings

-   The first edition contained only 3200 preferred headings

-   The 2nd (1926) and 3rd (1933) editions were again edited by her

-   [23rd is its latest print edition published in
    2022](https://greyhouse.com/Media/GreyHousePublishing/sears_list_22/index.html?page=1)

-   From fourth to fourteenth came in to exist in between (1939/1991)
    with addition of new word, modernize the terminology of old ones and
    so on

-   But the [format continued the same with some new features such as the
    addition of Abridged DDC numbers]{style="color: blue;"}

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

-   The orientation to the [online environment started with the 13th
    edition (1986) - 15th edition]{style="color: blue;"} is considered to be a innovative era of
    Sears. The latest knowledge from information science and information
    seeking behavior has been deployed to modernize the internal
    structure and grammar of the sears List
-   16th edition (1997), 17th edition (2000), 18th edition (2004), 19th
    edition (2007), 20th edition (2010), 21st (2014), 22nd edition
    (2018), 23rd edition (2022)
-   There are some changes has been seen in [15th edition like adoption
    of thesaurus format by using abbreviations, i.e. NT, BT, RT, USE and
    SA instead of X,XX etc.]{style="color: blue;"} It gave every page a new look

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

#### [Principles of the SEARS list]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It is based on the principles of the LoC Subject headings

-   The principles are:

1.  [**Specific Entry**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It means that subject should be entered under its most [specific
    heading, not under the class to which it belongs]{style="color: blue;"}. For example
    -   Rose should be entered under "Rose"/"Lotus" not under "flowers"
    -   Penguin is entered "Penguins" not under Birds or even not under
        water Birds

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

2.  [**Direct Entry**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It means that specific headings should be entered [directly as the
    lead point, instead of a subdivision]{style="color: blue;"}. For example

    -   Penguin is entered Penguin instead of water birds-penguin
    -   "Barbie doll" instead of Dolls-Barbie doll.
    -   Roses instead of Flowers-Roses dolls.

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

3.  [**Common Usage**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   If the word is more than one spelling, then the [most popular one
    chosen for common usage]{style="color: blue;"}. For example

    -   Instead of "Ornithology" use Birds
    -   Instead of "Banquets" use Dinner

4.  [**Uniformity**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Uniformity and consistency is essential for maintaining standard.

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

#### [Structure of SEARS List]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Sears list is an **alphabetical** subject heading {[arranged word by
    word according]{style="color: blue;"} to ALA Filling Rules (1980)}
-   Introductory part including the list of about 500 (common)
    subdivisions. It describes the brief history and principles of the
    Sears List
-   List of subject headings in alphabetical order given in two columns
    on every page

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### [List of Subject Headings]{style="color: blue;"}

-   All the headings are of two types:

A)  [**Non-preferred headings**]{style="color: blue;"}: These headings
    are those which are [not to be used]{style="color: blue;"}. Such headings are given in [light
    type face print]{style="color: blue;"}. Each such non-preferred heading is invariably
    [preceded by given a lead]{style="color: blue;"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
["USE"]{style="color: blue;"} directing us to the preferred heading, e.g.

-   Cyclopedias
    -   **Use Encyclopedias and Dictionaries**
-   Cyclotron
    -   **Use Cyclotrons**
-   Cytology
    -   **Use Cells**
-   Dairy farming
    -   **Use Dairying**
:::
:::

## SEARS LIST (Cont.)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
B)  [**Preferred headings**]{style="color: blue;"}: They are [authorized
    term represented in a bold face]{style="color: blue;"} for use against the document content

-   These headings are broadly categorized e.g. [ideas, objects, places,
    processes and relationships including DDC class number, scope notes,
    instruction for its further subdivision]{style="color: blue;"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The concepts and relations of words are mention by **NT, BT** and
    **RT**. Example

**Dairying**

-   **UF** Dairies

    -   Dairy farming

    -   Dairy industry

-   **BT** Agriculture

    -   Livestock industry

-   **NT** Dairy cattle

    -   Milk

## TAXONOMY

![](images/Taxonomy-2.jpg){fig-align="center" width="5000"}

-   It is the classification of entities in an ordered system that
    indicates natural relationships

-   Thus, taxonomy is a controlled vocabulary used to describe or
    characterize explicit concepts of information, fur purpose of
    capture, management, & presentation

## ONTOLOGY

## ONTOLOGY (Cont.)

-   A defined data model that describe **structured** and
    **unstructured** information through

    -   **entities**
    -   their **properties**
    -   the way they **related** to one another

-   Ontologies provides context

-   Effective ontologies require a deep understanding of the knowledge
    domain

-   Example: Digital Library

## SEMANTIC WEB

::: columns

-   **Connections through Citations**: Before the internet, you had
    scientists and individuals writing long documents that had
    references to other documents and those references were in the form
    of citations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Tedious Job of Finding the Citation (Might not even Accessible to
    you)**: As a reader of one of these documents, you read the citation
    and send out via mail for a copy of the document/visit the library

-   Not just the documents, not just the high-level links between
    applications but to [connect the data at a lower level]{style="color: blue;"}

-   So that that the data stored on one application would be [shareable
    and connectable]{style="color: blue;"} in another app

-   Go beyond just the document and get at the data level so that
    [specific data elements]{style="color: blue;"} can be

-   The main advantage is that you do not have to think about specific
    document but think about data and information

-   As Web 1.0 enabled you to not have to think about where the
    information was sitting you didn't have to think about the network
    layer and the machine layer

-   Similarly, Semantic Web enables you to [not have to think about
    specific document locations]{style="color: blue;"}
-   Semantic Web helps in representing information at a lower level than
    documents little facts and it connects them
