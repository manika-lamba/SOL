# Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) {background-color="#438496"}

## ISBD

-   [IFLA held an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles
    (ICCP) at Paris in 1961]{style="color: blue;"} with a purpose to
    achieve international standardization in cataloguing

-   [Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic
    Description]{style="color: blue;"} (ISBD) made it [economic &
    technological necessity for the creation, conversion, and use of
    machine-readable records]{style="color: blue;"}

-   These rules are standards to [promote universal bibliographic
    control]{style="color: blue;"}

-   [Consistency while sharing bibliographic
    information]{style="color: blue;"} is the main goal of ISBD

## ISBD (Cont.)

-   The most important contribution has been made by [ISBD(G) \[General
    International Standard Bibliographic
    Description\]]{style="color: blue;"} which is intended to provide
    the [generalized framework for descriptive
    information]{style="color: blue;"} required in range of [different
    bibliographic activities]{style="color: blue;"}

## FIVE PHASES IN DEVELOPMENT OF ISBD

1.  Creating a draft text

2.  Worldwide Review

3.  Final Revision

4.  Balloting

5.  Publication

## STRUCTURE OF ISBD

-   ISBD is divided into 8 areas on description

1.  Title and statement of responsibility
2.  Edition
3.  Material (or type of Publication) specific data (used for
    cartographic materials & serials)
4.  Publication, distribution data, including place & date of
    Publication
5.  Physical description
6.  Series
7.  Notes
8.  Standard number & terms of availability

## PURPOSE OF ISBD

-   It makes it possible to [interchange records from different sources]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It supports to [overcome]{style="color: blue;"} the [language barriers]{style="color: blue;"} and help to [interpret
    records from one language to other]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It facilitates the [conversion of bibliographic records to electronic
    form]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It [defines the selection and order of data elements]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It [prescribes punctuation marks to be used within a bibliography]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It establishes [compatibility]{style="color: blue;"} among cataloging for [exchange of
    bibligraphic records]{style="color: blue;"} for information centers

## Intro

-   MARC stands for **MA**chine **R**eadable **C**ataloging
-   Data indexing system which was developed by LoC in 1965
-   Allows computers to "understand" cataloging inputs
-   Parts of MARC record
    -   Fields: Contain Data
    -   Tags: Identify what is in the field (eg. 245 is title info.)
    -   Indicator: Tell computers how to work with field (eg. in title
        field there is a non-filing indicator, if we have

## Intro (Cont.)

-   Parts of MARC record
    -   "The History of Art" title, the browser will display we want to
        begin filing with "history" & not "the")
    -   Subfield: Sections of field
    -   Subfield Codes: Identify content of subfield (eg. in 245 field,
        subfield C is statement of responsibility)
