# Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) {background-color="#438496"}

## ISBD

-   IFLA held an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles
    (ICCP) at Paris in 1961 with a purpose to achieve international
    standardization in cataloguing

-   Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic Description
    (ISBD) made it economic & technological necessity for the creation,
    conversion, and use of machine-readable records

-   These rules are standards to promote universal bibliographic control

-   Consistency while sharing bibliographic information is the main goal
    of ISBD

## ISBD (Cont.)

-   The most important contribution has been made by ISBD(G) \[General
    International Standard Bibliographic Description\] which is intended
    to provide the generalized framework for descriptive information
    required in range of different bibliographic activities

## FIVE PHASES IN DEVELOPMENT OF ISBD

1.  Creating a draft text

2.  Worldwide Review

3.  Final Revision

4.  Balloting

5.  Publication

## STRUCTURE OF ISBD

-   ISBD is divided into 8 areas on description

1.  Title and statement of responsibility
2.  Edition
3.  Material (or type of Publication) specific data (used for
    cartographic materials & serials)
4.  Publication, distribution data, including place & date of
    Publication
5.  Physical description
6.  Series
7.  Notes
8.  Standard number & terms of availability

## PURPOSE OF ISBD

-   It makes it possible to interchange records from different sources

-   It supports to overcome the language barriers and help to interpret
    records from one language to other

-   It facilitates the conversion of bibliographic records to electronic
    form

-   It defines the selection and order of data elements

-   It prescribes punctuation marks to be used within a bibliography

-   It establishes compatibility among cataloging for exchange of
    bibligraphic records for information centers

## Intro

-   MARC stands for **MA**chine **R**eadable **C**ataloging
-   Data indexing system which was developed by LoC in 1965
-   Allows computers to "understand" cataloging inputs
-   Parts of MARC record
    -   Fields: Contain Data
    -   Tags: Identify what is in the field (eg. 245 is title info.)
    -   Indicator: Tell computers how to work with field (eg. in title
        field there is a non-filing indicator, if we have

## Intro (Cont.)

-   Parts of MARC record
    -   "The History of Art" title, the browser will display we want to
        begin filing with "history" & not "the")
    -   Subfield: Sections of field
    -   Subfield Codes: Identify content of subfield (eg. in 245 field,
        subfield C is statement of responsibility)
    -   Delimiters: Mark start of subfield
