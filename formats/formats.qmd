# Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) {background-color="#438496"}

## ISBD

-   [IFLA held an International Conference on Cataloguing Principles
    (ICCP) at Paris in 1961]{style="color: blue;"} with a purpose to
    achieve international standardization in cataloguing

-   [Standardization of International Standard Bibliographic
    Description]{style="color: blue;"} (ISBD) made it [economic &
    technological necessity for the creation, conversion, and use of
    machine-readable records]{style="color: blue;"}

-   These rules are standards to [promote universal bibliographic
    control]{style="color: blue;"}

-   [Consistency while sharing bibliographic
    information]{style="color: blue;"} is the main goal of ISBD

## ISBD (Cont.)

-   The most important contribution has been made by [ISBD(G) \[General
    International Standard Bibliographic
    Description\]]{style="color: blue;"} which is intended to provide
    the [generalized framework for descriptive
    information]{style="color: blue;"} required in range of [different
    bibliographic activities]{style="color: blue;"}

## FIVE PHASES IN DEVELOPMENT OF ISBD

1.  Creating a draft text

2.  Worldwide Review

3.  Final Revision

4.  Balloting

5.  Publication

## STRUCTURE OF ISBD

-   ISBD is divided into 8 areas on description

1.  Title and statement of responsibility
2.  Edition
3.  Material (or type of Publication) specific data (used for
    cartographic materials & serials)
4.  Publication, distribution data, including place & date of
    Publication
5.  Physical description
6.  Series
7.  Notes
8.  Standard number & terms of availability

## PURPOSE OF ISBD

-   It makes it possible to [interchange records from different sources]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It supports to [overcome]{style="color: blue;"} the [language barriers]{style="color: blue;"} and help to [interpret
    records from one language to other]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It facilitates the [conversion of bibliographic records to electronic
    form]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It [defines the selection and order of data elements]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It [prescribes punctuation marks to be used within a bibliography]{style="color: blue;"}

-   It establishes [compatibility]{style="color: blue;"} among cataloging for [exchange of
    bibligraphic records]{style="color: blue;"} for information centers

# MARC {background-color="#438496"}

## MARC

::: panel-tabset
## Intro

-   MARC stands for [**MA**chine **R**eadable **C**atalogue]{style="color: blue;"}
-   Data indexing system which was [developed by LoC in 1965]{style="color: blue;"}
-   [Allows computers to "understand" cataloging inputs]{style="color: blue;"}
- MARC code [does not provide an instruction on description of library materials]{style="color: blue;"}, but is a [standard format for bibliographic info. into a computerized record]{style="color: red;"}

- The
[information from a catalogue card cannot simply be typed into a computer to become part of
an automated catalogue]{style="color: blue;"}

## Intro
- The [computer needs some program or code to interpret the
info.]{style="color: blue;"} that is available in specific format on a catalogue card
- [MARC]{style="color: blue;"} standard has [ability]{style="color: blue;"}
to [encode the bibliographic information in machine-readable format]{style="color: blue;"}
- [MARC21 record contains various "signposts," before each piece of catalogue information]{style="color: blue;"}
so that it can be identified easily
- Info. in a MARC record is [stored in character form and records are coded in
extended ASCII format]{style="color: blue;"}
